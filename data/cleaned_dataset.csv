2,Chandler,"All right Joey, be nice. So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?"
6,Chandler,Sounds like a date to me.
7,Chandler,"Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked."
9,Chandler,"Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone... there."
14,Chandler,"All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me."
16,Chandler,"Finally, I figure I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother, which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!"
73,Chandler,"Please don't do that again, it's a horrible sound."
81,Chandler,"Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment."
91,Chandler,"I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. Paul, was it?"
111,Chandler,It's a beautiful thing.
113,Chandler,I would have to say that is an 'L'-shaped bracket.
115,Chandler,I have no idea.
120,Chandler,"Yes, please don't spoil all this fun."
125,Chandler,Oh my God!
140,Chandler,"Look, Ross, you gotta understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento. You, however have had the love of a woman for four years. Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and that is why we don't do it! I don't think that was my point!"
144,Chandler,"Stay out of my freezer!Scene: A Restaurant, Monica and Paul are still eating.]"
163,Chandler,"Angela's the screamer, Andrea has cats."
167,Chandler,That is amazing.
170,Chandler,"If can invade Poland, there isn't anything I can't do."
177,Chandler,"Hi, Paul, is it?"
186,Chandler,"All right, kids, I gotta get to work. If I don't input those numbers,... it doesn't make much of a difference..."
194,Chandler,"'Look, Gippetto, I'm a real live boy.'"
231,Chandler,And yet you're surprisingly upbeat.
233,Chandler,"Oh, how well you know me..."
293,Chandler,"Did you make it, or are you just serving it?"
299,Chandler,"Okay, so, I'm in Las Vegas... I'm Liza Minelli-"
305,Chandler,"Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out."
307,Chandler,"The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake."
330,Chandler,"Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding."
338,Chandler,"Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow."
344,Chandler,Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!
355,Chandler,You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days...
363,Chandler,"Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne..."
365,Chandler,Boys? We're going in.
372,Chandler,"Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon?"
377,Chandler,"I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done."
416,Chandler,What does she do?
420,Chandler,"Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred."
530,Chandler,"I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise."
552,Chandler,Or 'You're such a nice guy' means 'I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you'.
556,Chandler,"Yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm."
560,Chandler,"""So how does it feel knowing you're about to die?"""
562,Chandler,"Hey, that was really good!"
564,Chandler,"Okay. ""So. Whaddya want from me, Damone, huh?"""
567,Chandler,I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone.
569,Chandler,Relax your hand!
570,Chandler,Not so much!
574,Chandler,"Alright, now try taking a puff."
575,Chandler,Alright.. okay. No. Give it to me.
577,Chandler,"It's fine, it's fine. Look, do you wanna get this part, or not? Here."
578,Chandler,"Don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that's been missing from your hand. When you're holding it, you feel right. You feel complete."
593,Chandler,"Oh, Satan's minions at work again..."
605,Chandler,"I'm smoking. I'm smoking, I'm smoking."
607,Chandler,And this- is my reward!
609,Chandler,"Okay, so this time I won't quit!"
620,Chandler,What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!.. Sorry.
672,Chandler,"Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball.."
678,Chandler,I personally could have a gallon of Alan.
705,Chandler,"Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five?"
710,Chandler,"Hey, this is so unfair!"
712,Chandler,"So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, with that snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?"
733,Chandler,"Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease. The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it."
739,Chandler,"Ooh, Lambchop. How old is that sock? If I had a sock on my hand for thirty years it'd be talking too."
742,Chandler,"Joey ate my last stick of gum, so I killed him. Do you think that was wrong?"
796,Chandler,...That's it. I'm getting cigarettes.
804,Chandler,"Uh, if I were omnipotent for a day, I'd.. make myself omnipotent forever."
825,Chandler,You got waaaay too much free time.
827,Chandler,"Happy birthday, pal!"
832,Chandler,"Well, aren't we Mr. ""The glass is half empty."""
837,Chandler,Eleven days before Halloween.. all the good costumes are gone?
845,Chandler,You got it.
872,Chandler,We'll take a brief time out while Messier stops to look at some women's shoes.
909,Chandler,What? There was ice there that night with Carol? Plastic seats? Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans?
935,Chandler,"Hey, look, we're on that TV thing!"
989,Chandler,"Yes, the moon, the glow, the magical feeling, you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here, please?"
992,Chandler,"Well, what? What? What is it? That she left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women?"
1022,Chandler,"I think it's great. Y'know, it's sweet, it's romantic..."
1028,Chandler,"Oh, I thought you were great in Silence of the Lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All things considered, you had fun tonight."
1033,Chandler,"You gotta do it, man."
1045,Chandler,"Hello? Oh, uh, Rachel, it's the Visa card people."
1056,Chandler,"We can? All right, I'm tryin' that."
1060,Chandler,"So, Saturday night, the big night, date night, Saturday night, Sat-ur-day night!"
1062,Chandler,Not a one.
1064,Chandler,"Oh, right, right, shut up."
1066,Chandler,"No, I know, but it's just so hard, you know? I mean, you're sitting there with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally get up the courage to do it, and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note."
1069,Chandler,"Oh, thanks, but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her."
1080,Chandler,"Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that."
1121,Chandler,"Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through?"
1123,Chandler,"It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date."
1127,Chandler,"Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear. This is basically the first time she's gonna see your underwearÂ—you want it to be dirty?"
1129,Chandler,"Oh, and uh, the fabric softener?"
1131,Chandler,There you go.
1141,Chandler,Where are they? Where are they?
1143,Chandler,It's great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some puppies.
1145,Chandler,Here we go.
1149,Chandler,"Hey, that's not good. Can I get an espresso and a latte over here, please?"
1155,Chandler,Bullwinkle socks. That's so sweet.
1158,Chandler,"Well, I'm gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte?"
1162,Chandler,"Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal."
1213,Chandler,"Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore. Janice."
1247,Chandler,"Oh, my god, I'm so sorry. Are you ok?"
1251,Chandler,"Oh, I don't know, a million?"
1255,Chandler,I'm not fine. Here she comes.
1257,Chandler,How do you do that?
1259,Chandler,We should always always break up together.
1289,Chandler,I'm free! I'm free!
1292,Chandler,"You can always spot someone who's never seen one of his plays before. Notice, no fear, no sense of impending doom..."
1301,Chandler,"No, ten o'clock."
1305,Chandler,"She's amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look like short, fat, bald men!"
1307,Chandler,"Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me. Blarrglarrghh.'"
1309,Chandler,"Oh please, could she be more out of my league? Ross, back me up here."
1311,Chandler,"Thank you, buddy."
1316,Chandler,"Oh God, I can't believe I'm even considering this... I'm very very aware of my tongue..."
1336,Chandler,"Well, I can't believe I've been here almost seven seconds and you haven't asked me how my date went."
1338,Chandler,It was unbelievable. I-I've never met anyone like her. She's had the most amazing life! She was in the Israeli army...
1340,Chandler,"Alright. Once I got on the subway, right, and it was at night, and I rode it all the way to Brooklyn... just for the hell of it."
1342,Chandler,"Oh, I'm sorry, so 'we' is?"
1346,Chandler,"Oh, so you're divorced?"
1348,Chandler,"Oh, I'm sorry, then you're widowed?...Hopefully?"
1350,Chandler,"So tell me, how do- how do you think your husband would feel about you sitting here with me?...Sliding your foot so far up my pant leg you can count the change in my pocket?"
1352,Chandler,"Ethan? There's, there's an Ethan?"
1354,Chandler,"So explain something to me here, uh, what kind of a relationship do you imagine us having if you already have a husband and a boyfriend?"
1357,Chandler,What 'not work out'? I'm seeing her again on Thursday. Didn't you listen to the story?
1359,Chandler,"Well, y'know, I had some trouble with it at first too, but the way I look at it is, I get all the good stuff: all the fun, all the talking, all the sex; and none of the responsibility. I mean, this is every guy's fantasy!"
1372,Chandler,Are we greeting each other this way now? 'Cause I like that.
1383,Chandler,"Thank God you didn't try to fan out the magazines. I mean, she'll scratch your eyes right out."
1395,Chandler,"Someone's left a glass on the coffee table. There's no coaster. It's a cold drink, it's a hot day. Little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and closer to the surface of the wood..."
1411,Chandler,"Oh no, it's terrific, it's... it's... y'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into showbusiness."
1420,Chandler,Where's Joey? His mom's on the phone.
1425,Chandler,"Oh, that would be Monica. Hey, listen, I wanna borrow a coupla things, Aurora spent the night, I really wanna make her breakfast."
1444,Chandler,"God, I love these fingers..."
1446,Chandler,"No, actually I meant my fingers. Look at 'em, look at how happy they are."
1454,Chandler,"Well, I thought- I thought you talked to Rick."
1456,Chandler,"What, Ethan? He got to spend the whole day with you!"
1458,Chandler,"I know there'll be many moments in the years to come when I'll regret asking the following question, but- And Andrew is?"
1460,Chandler,"Oh, so what you're saying is you're not completely fulfilled by Rick, Ethan and myself?"
1462,Chandler,"Well, y'know, most women would kill for three guys like us."
1466,Chandler,"Nono, just you."
1468,Chandler,Lose the other guys.
1470,Chandler,"C'mon, we're great together, why not?"
1472,Chandler,"...Well, y'know, part of me wants that, but it's like I'm two guys, y'know? I mean, one guy's going 'Shut up! This is great!' But there's this other guy. Actually it's the same guy that wells up every time that Grinch's heart grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device... And he's saying, y'know, 'This is too hard! Get out! Get out!'"
1474,Chandler,"I don't know, I-I have to listen to both of them, they don't exactly let each other finish..."
1476,Chandler,...The second guy.
1478,Chandler,"Sorry, the first guy runs the lips."
1491,Chandler,Something so sweet and...disturbing about that.
1508,Chandler,"Oh, great. This is just..."
1515,Chandler,"Oh my God, it's that Victoria's Secret model. Something... something Goodacre."
1518,Chandler,Jill says vestibule... I'm going with vestibule.
1520,Chandler,"Oh! Some guy. Some guy. 'Hey Jill, I saw you with some guy last night. Yes, he was some guy."
1526,Chandler,"Alright, alright, alright. It's been fourteen and a half minutes and you still have not said one word. Oh God, do something. Just make contact, smile!"
1527,Chandler,There you go!
1528,Chandler,You're definitely scaring here.
1532,Chandler,"Hey, it's me."
1536,Chandler,I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth Jll Gdcr!
1540,Chandler,I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth JLL GDCR.
1542,Chandler,"Yeah, like that thought never entered my mind."
1599,Chandler,"Um, is it sugarless?"
1601,Chandler,"Oh, then no thanks. What the hell was that? Mental note: If Jill Goodacre offers you gum, you take it. If she offers you mangled animal carcass, you take it."
1733,Chandler,"Yes. Yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my life."
1735,Chandler,"Hi, um, I'm account number 7143457. And, uh, I don't know if you got any of that, but I would really like a copy of the tape."
1736,Chandler,Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it get better than this?
1738,Chandler,"Ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem. Had you said 'co-dependent', or 'self-destructive'..."
1742,Chandler,He's a he?
1744,Chandler,"...Couldn't enjoy a cup of noodles after that. I mean, is that ridiculous? Can you believe she actually thought that?"
1748,Chandler,"Huh. Did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me?"
1753,Chandler,You're kidding! Did you tell her I wasn't?
1755,Chandler,"Well, this is fascinating. So, uh, what is it about me?"
1757,Chandler,"Ross is smart and funny, d'you ever think that about him?"
1759,Chandler,WHAT IS IT?!
1762,Chandler,"Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this."
1800,Chandler,"I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?"
1836,Chandler,"No, nono, don't- don't worry about it. Believe me, apparently other people have made the same mistake."
1838,Chandler,"So, uh... what do you think it is about me?"
1840,Chandler,"...Quality, right, great."
1842,Chandler,"Lowell? Financial Services' Lowell, that's who you saw me with?"
1844,Chandler,"Well, yeah... 's'no Brian in Payroll."
1846,Chandler,"No! Uh, I d'know! The point is, if you were gonna set me up with someone, I'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like him."
1848,Chandler,Excuse me? You don't think I could get a Brian? Because I could get a Brian. Believe you me. ...I'm really not.
1878,Chandler,"Well, don't we look nice all dressed up?...It's stuff like that, isn't it?"
1882,Chandler,"Nothing, just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Mussberger."
1884,Chandler,You're watching a football game at a funeral?
1886,Chandler,"You are a frightening, frightening man."
1901,Chandler,"Hi, I'm Chandler, and I have no idea who Dorothy is."
1946,Chandler,Who are those people?
1956,Chandler,So how's it going there in Financial Services?
1958,Chandler,"Good, good. Listen, heh, I dunno what Shelley told you about me, but, uh... I'm not."
1962,Chandler,So- you can tell?
1964,Chandler,"So you don't think I have a, a quality?"
1988,Chandler,And this from the cry-for-help department. Are you wearing makeup?
1990,Chandler,"That's so funny, 'cause I was thinking you look more like Joey Tribbiani, man slash woman."
1995,Chandler,Do you know which one you're gonna be?
1997,Chandler,"Good luck, man. I hope you get it."
2005,Chandler,"Yes, every single one of them."
2012,Chandler,I thought it was $98.50.
2038,Chandler,"I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment. In fact, I'd very much like to butter your head."
2053,Chandler,"All right, I'm nine years old."
2055,Chandler,"We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced."
2057,Chandler,Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.
2079,Chandler,"Tonight, on a very special Blossom."
2085,Chandler,"Oh, you must stop shooping."
2088,Chandler,"No, I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment."
2090,Chandler,"Ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not funny anymore."
2105,Chandler,The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten away.
2107,Chandler,"No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's all over the news. Right before he reached Macy's, he broke free and was spotted flying over Washington Square Park. I'm goin' to the roof, who's with me?"
2109,Chandler,Come on. An 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. How often does that happen?
2127,Chandler,Do either of you have the keys?
2165,Chandler,"Ok, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open. Here we go."
2174,Chandler,Now this feels like Thanksgiving.
2181,Chandler,Shall I carve?
2183,Chandler,"Ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?"
2191,Chandler,"I'd like to propose a toast. Little toast here, ding ding. I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked."
2206,Chandler,"Hey, that monkey's got a Ross on its ass!"
2212,Chandler,Might wanna open with the snowman.
2221,Chandler,"Nothing for you, you have Paolo. You don't have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday: desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you can have someone to kiss when the ball drops!! Man, I'm talking loud!"
2224,Chandler,"It's just that I'm sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday. I say this year, no dates, we make a pact. Just the six of us- dinner."
2226,Chandler,"Y'know, I was hoping for a little more enthusiasm."
2258,Chandler,"Wait a minute, wait a minute, I see where this is going, you're gonna ask him to New Year's, aren't you. You're gonna break the pact. She's gonna break the pact."
2260,Chandler,"Yeah, 'cause I already asked Janice."
2263,Chandler,"I snapped, okay? I couldn't handle the pressure and I snapped."
2265,Chandler,"I'm not saying it was a good idea, I'm saying I snapped!"
2267,Chandler,Too many jokes... must mock Joey!
2269,Chandler,"Aah, y'killing me!"
2274,Chandler,"Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you."
2276,Chandler,"Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie."
2295,Chandler,Fun Bobby? Your ex-boyfriend Fun Bobby?
2298,Chandler,I happen to know a Fun Bob.
2314,Chandler,"That's so weird, I had such a blast with him the other night."
2316,Chandler,"Yeah, we played, we watched TV.. that juggling thing is amazing."
2318,Chandler,With the balled-up socks? I figured you taught him that.
2320,Chandler,"Y'know, it wasn't that big a deal. He just balled up socks... and a melon..."
2357,Chandler,You remember Janice.
2382,Chandler,Kill me. Kill me now.
2388,Chandler,"Alright, Janice, that's it! Janice... Janice... Hey, Janice, when I invited you to this party I didn't necessarily think that it meant that we-"
2390,Chandler,I'm sorry you misunderstood...
2412,Chandler,"Ooh. Uh, I don't know how to tell you this, but she's in Monica's bedroom, getting it on with Max, that scientist geek. Ooh, look at that, I did know how to tell you."
2417,Chandler,And the moment of joy is upon us.
2427,Chandler,"Alright, somebody kiss me. Somebody kiss me, it's midnight! Somebody kiss me!"
2458,Chandler,Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?
2464,Chandler,"Y'know, we don't have to watch this. Weekend At Bernie's is on Showtime, HBO, and Cinemax."
2467,Chandler,"Exactly. Weekend At Bernie's! Dead guy getting hit in the groin twenty, thirty times! No?"
2469,Chandler,"Yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.'"
2471,Chandler,You can say that because she's not your mom.
2482,Chandler,"Shhh, busy beaming with pride."
2484,Chandler,Now why would she say that's embarrassing?
2487,Chandler,THAT'S TOO MUCH INFORMATION!!
2491,Chandler,This is the way that I find out. Most moms use the phone.
2494,Chandler,...And then he burst into flames.
2501,Chandler,Please God don't let it be Kung Pow Chicken.
2503,Chandler,"Well, I think you need to come out of your shell just a little."
2506,Chandler,I know I am.
2517,Chandler,"Myyy mother, ladies and gentlemen."
2548,Chandler,What are you guys doing out here?
2586,Chandler,Oh my God.
2588,Chandler,I can't believe it. Paolo kissed my mom?
2594,Chandler,"I spent the entire day with you, why didn't you tell me?!"
2599,Chandler,"Y'know, of all my friends, no-one knows the crap I go through with my mom more than you."
2604,Chandler,I'm still mad at you for not telling me.
2633,Chandler,What was that?
2638,Chandler,"Yes, well, I expect this from her. Okay? She's always been a Freudian nightmare."
2640,Chandler,"Because it's complicated, it's complex- Hey, you kissed my mom!"
2642,Chandler,That's very funny. We done now?
2644,Chandler,"That would be no. Look, just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom doesn't mean you know her. Alright? Trust me, you can't talk to her."
2675,Chandler,"No, just knowing you're gonna be there is enough."
2677,Chandler,You kissed my best Ross! ...Or something to that effect.
2681,Chandler,Yeah. No. No...
2704,Chandler,Awful. Awful. Couldn'ta gone worse.
2706,Chandler,Pretty good! I told her.
2715,Chandler,"No-no-no-no, we're done."
2739,Chandler,"Ok, you're going to have to stop that, forever!"
2776,Chandler,"Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one?"
2778,Chandler,"What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!"
2780,Chandler,"Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio"
2782,Chandler,"Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination."
2784,Chandler,"What do you mean, like, buy it together?"
2786,Chandler,You think we're ready for something like that?
2788,Chandler,"Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to move out?"
2790,Chandler,I'm not moving out.
2792,Chandler,"Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip..."
2794,Chandler,"It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly."
2796,Chandler,"Aw, don't do that"
2830,Chandler,"More coffee over here, please!"
2845,Chandler,So what are you gonna do?
2847,Chandler,"Oh, yeah, you have to tell her."
2852,Chandler,That's patio furniture!
2856,Chandler,You pick one.
2858,Chandler,"Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining!"
2876,Chandler,"So, what do you think?"
2910,Chandler,"What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in!"
2966,Chandler,"Yeah, get out!"
2973,Chandler,"Rachel, wait, wait."
2975,Chandler,Can I just say one thing?
2977,Chandler,That's a relatively open weave and I can still see your... nipular areas.
2995,Chandler,"No, she's still upset because I saw her boobies."
2997,Chandler,It was an accident. Not like I was across the street with a telescope and a box of donuts.
3001,Chandler,"Y'know, I don't know why you're so embarrassed, they were very nice boobies."
3005,Chandler,"Whoah whoah, back up there, Sparky. What'd you mean by that?"
3009,Chandler,"Uhhuh, how did you know that?"
3040,Chandler,"Y'know, I don't see that happening?"
3042,Chandler,Well I'm not showing you my 'tat.'
3050,Chandler,"Oh, it's nothing, it's a little thing... I hate that guy."
3073,Chandler,"Oh look, it's the woman we ordered."
3078,Chandler,"Uh, Joey's having an embolism, but I'd go for a Nip, y'know?"
3080,Chandler,"Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys."
3089,Chandler,"So, who's up for a big game of Kerplunk?"
3104,Chandler,"C'mon, I'll show you to my room. ...That sounds so weird when it's not followed by ""No thanks, it's late."""
3112,Chandler,"Hey, Kicky. What're you doing?"
3114,Chandler,"Well, you're gonna."
3116,Chandler,"Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?"
3118,Chandler,"Hey, you're not him. You're you. When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?"
3120,Chandler,"No. You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. Now that wasn't easy, but you did it! And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say ""No thanks, I'm married."""
3122,Chandler,Yeah. I really do.
3145,Chandler,"Sorry, my my thing was in there with me."
3153,Chandler,Basically we just feel that he's...
3193,Chandler,Things sure have changed here on Waltons mountain.
3197,Chandler,"If I turn into my parents, I'll either be an alcoholic blond chasing after twenty-year-old boys, or... I'll end up like my mom."
3221,Chandler,"Come on, Ross, you gotta get back in the game here, ok? The Rachel thing's not happening, your ex-wife is a lesbianÂ—I don't think we need a third..."
3225,Chandler,I think it's winning.
3227,Chandler,"She'll love it. Go with the egg, my friend."
3229,Chandler,"No, it's suicide. The man's got an egg."
3238,Chandler,"Oh, uh, listen, about tonight..."
3240,Chandler,"Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a..."
3247,Chandler,...And what did you bring?
3252,Chandler,"Ok, I'm makin' a break for it, I'm goin' out the window."
3254,Chandler,Calm down? Calm down? You set me up with the woman that I've dumped twice in the last five months!
3283,Chandler,"Tell me it's ""you and me"" we."
3285,Chandler,"Ok, you can not do this to me."
3289,Chandler,I hope she throws up on you.
3292,Chandler,"Oh, what a crappy night!"
3296,Chandler,Joey's not a friend. He's...a stupid man who left us his credit card. Another drink? Some dessert? A big screen TV?
3303,Chandler,"No... no! And yet it did. Good-bye, Janice."
3308,Chandler,"Ok, well, this was very special."
3311,Chandler,Janice is gonna go away now.
3315,Chandler,"Oh, good, Joey's home now."
3341,Chandler,How can I dump this woman on Valentine's day?
3343,Chandler,"Oh, man. In my next life, I'm coming back as a toilet brush."
3345,Chandler,"Hi, Just Janice."
3367,Chandler,"Ok, Janice. Janice. Hey, Janice. Look, there's no way for me to tell you this. At least there's no new way for me to tell you this. I just don't things are gonna work out."
3371,Chandler,"Oh no, you see, actually it is."
3373,Chandler,"Oh, no I don't."
3375,Chandler,"I did, but..."
3412,Chandler,"Mrs. Tedlock. You're looking lovely today. And may I say, that is a very flattering sleeve length on you."
3421,Chandler,"So, it's a typical day at work. I'm inputting my numbers, and big Al calls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor."
3423,Chandler,So.... I quit.
3425,Chandler,Why? This was supposed to be a temp job!
3427,Chandler,"If I took this promotion, it'd be like admitting that this is what I actually do."
3429,Chandler,It doesn't matter. I just don't want to be one of those guys that's in his office until twelve o'clock at night worrying about the WENUS.
3431,Chandler,Weekly Estimated Net Usage Systems. A processing term.
3434,Chandler,I don't know. That's the thing. I don't know what I want to do. I just know I'm not going to figure it out working there.
3438,Chandler,Yeah... I just don't have that much cheffing experience. Unless it's an all-toast restaurant.
3444,Chandler,"Thanks, Phoebe. But I just don't really see myself in a big white hat."
3446,Chandler,Can you see my nipples through this shirt?
3451,Chandler,"Hey, you guys all know what you want to do."
3453,Chandler,"Hey, you guys in the living room all know what you want to do. You know, you have goals. You have dreams. I don't have a dream."
3459,Chandler,Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?
3469,Chandler,Who are you going out with?
3475,Chandler,And he's not speaking metaphorically.
3491,Chandler,"Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really cool? You know, I just always pictured myself doing something...something."
3494,Chandler,"Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you."
3550,Chandler,It's OK. It's OK. I was always rooting for you two kids to get together.
3564,Chandler,"Thank you Helen, that'll be all."
3565,Chandler,"Last time I do that, I promise."
3950,Chandler,What are you crazy? That's a baby!
3953,Chandler,"Hey, you're gonna be fine. You're one of the most caring, most responsible men in North America. You're gonna make a great dad."
3956,Chandler,"Well, only if you order stuff."
3963,Chandler,There it is! So what're you gonna do?
3965,Chandler,And your friend Phoebe?
3967,Chandler,"Man, if you tried something like that on my birthday, you'd be starin' at the business end of a hissy fit."
3985,Chandler,"Alright, what have we learned so far?"
4000,Chandler,Did you see Betty?
4128,Chandler,"Okay, worst case scenario. Say you never feel like a father."
4130,Chandler,"Say your son never feels connected to you, as one. Say all of his relationships are affected by this."
4132,Chandler,"You know, you think I would."
4133,Chandler,What's up with the simian?
4137,Chandler,"No, no, you got zero points for 'IDNEY'."
4143,Chandler,Marcel swallowed a Scrabble tile.
4183,Chandler,We think he was trying to spell out 'MONKEY.'
4187,Chandler,"Hey, come on, you came through, you did what you had to do. That is very dad."
4201,Chandler,"Well, if you're gonna work for mechanics, those are the ones to work for."
4220,Chandler,"You know, I can't believe you. Linda is so great! Why won't you go out with her again?"
4222,Chandler,Is this still about her whole 'The Flintstones could've really happened' thing?
4224,Chandler,...little playthings with yarn?
4226,Chandler,Could you want her more?
4234,Chandler,We're notÂ—we're not saying anything.
4241,Chandler,And then he did.
4246,Chandler,There just don't happen to be any women in our games.
4260,Chandler,"OK Phoebs, how many do you want?"
4282,Chandler,"Rach, Rach, we gotta settle."
4284,Chandler,"The... Jamestown colony of Virginia. You see, King George is giving us the land, so..."
4294,Chandler,"Yes, and I get my ya-yas from Ikea. You have to put them together yourself, but they cost a little less."
4299,Chandler,"Oh, did you get that from the 'I Love Rachel' pizzeria?"
4342,Chandler,"Um, ok... the... the fifth dentist caved and now they're all recommending Trident?"
4348,Chandler,"Oh yes, yes, we could play some other game... like, uh, I don't know... Pictionary?"
4360,Chandler,"That's alright, I'll take it. Bad things happen to me anyway. This way I can break 'em up with a movie."
4381,Chandler,"Hey, that's... that's 'joincidence' with a 'C'!"
4409,Chandler,"Y'know, I've had dates like this."
4462,Chandler,Airplane! Airport! Airport '75! Airport '77! Airport '79!
4511,Chandler,"They're still just friends, right?"
4516,Chandler,I can't believe we are even having this discussion.
4518,Chandler,"I mean, don't you think if things were gonna happen with Rachel, they would've happened already?"
4524,Chandler,I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey.
4526,Chandler,"Hey, y'know what you should do? You should take her back to the 1890's, when that phrase was last used."
4537,Chandler,Rachel lost Marcel.
4545,Chandler,"Okay, it's his first time out, so he's probably gonna wanna do some of the touristy things. I'll go to Cats, you go to the Russian Tea Room."
4622,Chandler,"Um, we're kind of having an emergency and we-we were looking for something..."
4624,Chandler,Yes have you seen any?
4631,Chandler,"Oh, nononowaitwaitwaitnono! Uh... we may not know anything about radiators per se, but we do have a certain amount of expertise in the heating and cooling... mileu."
4633,Chandler,"Yes, but these women are very hot, and they need our help! And they're very hot."
4635,Chandler,"Okay, from now on, you don't get to talk to other people."
4713,Chandler,Eh. I thought that was an alp.
4716,Chandler,"Yeah, well I went to boarding school with four hundred boys. Any sex I had would've involved a major lifestyle choice."
4719,Chandler,I can't believe you would actually say that. I would much rather be Mr.Peanut than Mr.Salty.
4725,Chandler,I feel violated. And not in a good way.
4727,Chandler,"I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time. It was unbelievable! We could totally be ourselves, we didn't have to play any games..."
4735,Chandler,"No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up."
4737,Chandler,"Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase ""Yes indeedy-o."""
4760,Chandler,I have my reasons.
4770,Chandler,"Hey, I've been honing!"
4772,Chandler,"Oh, uh.. I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know? I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours."
4781,Chandler,What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that.
4799,Chandler,Can I use your phone?
4801,Chandler,"Yes, it's working! Why isn't she calling me back?"
4804,Chandler,Y'don't think that makes me seem a little...
4806,Chandler,"Ah, you obviously saw my personal ad."
4810,Chandler,"I'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy."
4825,Chandler,"If it helps, I could slide over."
4831,Chandler,So how's Mindy?
4834,Chandler,Hell is filled with people like you.
4847,Chandler,"Okay, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Will you watch my phone?"
4849,Chandler,"Hey, we haven't been on a second date, she needs to hear me pee?"
4851,Chandler,"I can't call her, I left a message! I have some pride."
4855,Chandler,'S'why I'm dancing...
4888,Chandler,"Ring dammit, ring!"
4946,Chandler,"Danielle! Hi! Uh- everybody, this is Danielle, Danielle, everybody."
4948,Chandler,What are you doing here?
4950,Chandler,"...I'm, I'm okay."
4952,Chandler,"That sounds good. I'll call you- or you call me, whatever..."
4962,Chandler,"Well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about her coming all the way down here, just to see if I was okay? I mean,... how needy is that?"
4968,Chandler,"Wow, what a geek. They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop."
4975,Chandler,"Well, that's what we said about Joey..."
4992,Chandler,How about Joey... Pepponi?
4998,Chandler,"Well, it does not ring a bell with me..."
5000,Chandler,Might wanna try Joseph.
5002,Chandler,"Oh yes! Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof."
5047,Chandler,"She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?"
5051,Chandler,So what does this mean?
5054,Chandler,"I don't get it, I mean, you just got him. How can he be an adult already?"
5059,Chandler,"I know that one! ...No, that's Popes into a Volkswagen."
5061,Chandler,"Yeah, but that's like two blocks away from the beach. I mean, it's a total party zoo."
5066,Chandler,Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice.
5070,Chandler,...Take off their hats!
5097,Chandler,"Y'know, you'd think I would've."
5159,Chandler,"Okay, bye, champ. Now, I know there's gonna be a lot of babes in San Diego, but remember, there's also a lot to learn."
5179,Chandler,Tell me what?
5187,Chandler,"More importantly, was I any good?"
5192,Chandler,You're okay there?
5194,Chandler,"I'm sorry, it was a one-time-thing. I was very drunk and i was somebody else's subconscious."
5208,Chandler,"Well, you know Phoebs. I don't know if it's your kinda thing, because it involves a lot of being normal. For a large portion of the day."
5215,Chandler,"A cool phone number, and a possible name for the kid."
5221,Chandler,When we were?
5224,Chandler,Whoa! And this manchild has no problem with how old you are?
5231,Chandler,Can you hear that?
5233,Chandler,See that'll stop when you pick up the phone.
5236,Chandler,I'm not in a meeting. I'm right... Whoops.
5242,Chandler,"Well, now, I actually have to get to work."
5272,Chandler,Noho. Who doesn't they like me?
5274,Chandler,What are you talking about?
5276,Chandler,I can't belive it.
5278,Chandler,They do me?
5280,Chandler,I don't sound like that.
5286,Chandler,"Okay, I don't sound like that. That is so not true."
5287,Chandler,"That is so not... That is so not... That... Oh, shut up!"
5334,Chandler,"Oh, come on. You told me about the last dream."
5336,Chandler,"Oh, why not. Was I doing anything particularly... saucy?"
5357,Chandler,And this has nothing to do with the fact that he needs a note to get out of gym.
5369,Chandler,Work people? Nobody told me.
5371,Chandler,"You know, I don't get this. A month ago, these people were my friends. You know, just because I'm in charge doesn't mean I'm a different person."
5373,Chandler,You think I should?
5379,Chandler,"I Think last night was great. You know, the Karaoke thing. Tracy and I doing Ebony and Ivory."
5383,Chandler,"Then, I don't get it."
5387,Chandler,I just wan't to...
5389,Chandler,But I just wa...
5415,Chandler,"Thanks. Listen, about the weekly numbers, I'm gonna need them on my desk by nine o'clock."
5418,Chandler,"You have to give 'em something, you know. Okay, now that was Gerston, Santos, and who's the guy with the moustache?"
5420,Chandler,"Petrie, right, right. Okay, some people gonna be working this weekend."
5442,Chandler,"Yeah, like in a cab..."
5444,Chandler,"Okay, hating this."
5449,Chandler,"Here we go, here we go."
5458,Chandler,"Yes, Joey's made arrangements to have his baby in a movie from the 50's."
5462,Chandler,You have to pick your moments.
5471,Chandler,I used to have that bumper sticker.
5495,Chandler,"Mmmm. Not tonight, honey. I got an early day tomorrow."
5497,Chandler,"Oh, ok, 'cause we never do that."
5521,Chandler,You'll get one.
5523,Chandler,"All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?"
5525,Chandler,"Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically."
5527,Chandler,"No, no, no."
5538,Chandler,"Rachel, what is the deal with you and doctors, anyway? Was, like, your father a doctor?"
5622,Chandler,Where have you been?
5705,Chandler,"I know, I still am one of these."
5729,Chandler,"Oh, yeah, right, OK... inlcuding the waffles last week, you now owe me... 17 jillion dollars."
5745,Chandler,"Then put out fire by peeing, no get invited back."
5786,Chandler,"Uh, let's see... Alvin... Simon... Theodore.... no."
5789,Chandler,Forget about her.
5791,Chandler,"Course there, they just call it food."
5796,Chandler,I'm still on my first. I just think you're nice.
5818,Chandler,"Yes, the doctors say if they remove it, he'll die."
5820,Chandler,"Oh, that's Ross's."
5827,Chandler,"Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?"
5837,Chandler,No it's not. It's small. It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee.
5839,Chandler,"OK, is there a mute button on this woman?"
5847,Chandler,What about the time difference?
5852,Chandler,Well then maybe you shouldn't go.
5912,Chandler,So how'd it go?
5914,Chandler,The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me.
5916,Chandler,"Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route."
5918,Chandler,I didn't know you had another level.
5936,Chandler,"Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?"
5938,Chandler,"Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?"
5997,Chandler,"Yes, yes, we did, thanks to Vidal Buffay."
6000,Chandler,"Ok, I think she's trying to tell us something. Quick, get the verbs."
6025,Chandler,"Well, listen, don't tell us what's gonna happen though, 'cause I like to be surprised."
6030,Chandler,"Hey, Rach, can I get..."
6034,Chandler,"So what the hell happened to you in China? I mean, when last we left you, you were totally in love with, you know."
6038,Chandler,"Well, maybe it was God, doing me."
6040,Chandler,"Well, you owe me one, big guy."
6046,Chandler,"He said...he said, he said that they're having a great time. I'm sorry. But, the silver lining, if you wanna see it, is that he made the decision all by himself! Without any outside help whatsoever."
6048,Chandler,You have to really wanna see it.
6064,Chandler,"No, no, I'm just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk."
6066,Chandler,Okay. You have to stop the Q-tip when there's resistance!
6077,Chandler,"Ok, I don't care what you guys say, something's bothering her."
6085,Chandler,What stupid thing did you do?
6096,Chandler,People do stupid things when they're upset.
6108,Chandler,"Well, in spite of the yummy bagels and palpable tension, I've got pants that need to be altered."
6110,Chandler,Are you sure he's gonna be able to crack that code?
6134,Chandler,At least as long as I have the pants.
6157,Chandler,Joey's tailor...took advantage of me.
6160,Chandler,"Oh come on! He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite..."
6169,Chandler,"Come on, Monica, things could be worse. You could get caught between the moon and New York City. I know it's crazy, but it's true."
6204,Chandler,We're just hanging out by the spoons. Ladle?
6209,Chandler,Carol? I was just wondering if Joey could ask you a question about breast-feeding?
6214,Chandler,"So, uh, how often can you do it?"
6233,Chandler,"Come on, you're going to Bloomingdale's with Julie? That's like cheating on Rachel in her house of worship."
6288,Chandler,What did you just do?
6294,Chandler,What did you just do?
6336,Chandler,Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.
6350,Chandler,"Well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed."
6356,Chandler,You're damn right I'm right. I say you show this guy what you're made of. I say you stand your ground. I say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie.
6358,Chandler,All right. Now go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.
11546,Chandler,"Yeah, like there's any way I could ever do that."
11549,Chandler,"Hey, you know what, here's a thought. Why don't you stay home from work today and just hang out with me."
11551,Chandler,I can not believe that I am going out with someone that is getting divorced. I'm such a grown up.
11553,Chandler,"Well, maybe I won't kiss you, and then you'll have to stay."
11557,Chandler,"Nope, not this time."
11559,Chandler,I'm not yanking you.
11561,Chandler,"Yeah, I know. She makes me happy."
11636,Chandler,"You know, you should really go on this show. All right, listen, I got three tickets to the Rangers tonight. What'd ya' say?"
11640,Chandler,"You know, I may be way out on a limb here, but do you, do you, have a problem with Janice?"
11642,Chandler,"Ooh, that girl that I hate, eww, drives me crazy, eww, eww, oh!"
11644,Chandler,"Well, there you go."
11648,Chandler,I want you to say that you like her!
11699,Chandler,"Girth? Why, why, why, wh-why, why, why, why would they do this?"
11701,Chandler,We're not gonna talk about girth are we?
11705,Chandler,Yeah! All right! You go first.
11709,Chandler,Princess Leia in the gold bikini.
11715,Chandler,"Okay, you know, you know when your in bed, with a woman."
11717,Chandler,"And, ah, you know, your fooling around with her. And you get all these like, mental images in your brain, you know, like Elle MacPherson, or that girl at the Xerox place...."
11725,Chandler,What are you guys doing together?
11730,Chandler,You still can't stand her can you?
11732,Chandler,"Well, you know, I appreciate you giving it a shot."
11734,Chandler,"Well, I guess that's something."
11773,Chandler,"Yeah, I know, I did that two minutes ago."
11775,Chandler,"Hey, mister tux!"
11807,Chandler,You're in my seat.
11809,Chandler,'Cause I was sitting there.
11811,Chandler,"Well, it's not like I went to Spain. I went to the bathroom, you knew I was coming back."
11813,Chandler,"The big deal is I was sitting there last, so, that's my seat."
11832,Chandler,"Well, Joey, I wrote a little song today. It's called: Get Up."
11844,Chandler,"Honey, you did call him back. 'Cause, it's, it's really old."
11857,Chandler,Maybe he's calling to say your obsessive and crazy.
11889,Chandler,"Maybe it was his sister's. You know, maybe it was his daughter's."
11897,Chandler,"All right, you will notice that I am fully dressed. I, in turn, have noticed that you are not. So in the words of A. A. Milne, ""Get out of my chair, dillhole!"""
11899,Chandler,What are you doing?
11901,Chandler,The cushions are the essence of the chair!
11903,Chandler,"Oh-ho, it'll be back. Oh-ho, there's nobody in the room."
11913,Chandler,We used them as pillows when we went camping.
11919,Chandler,He took my essence!
11924,Chandler,"Well, then it looks like somebody is gonna have to give back somebody his cushions."
11926,Chandler,"What are you, what are you gonna show me my clothes?"
11928,Chandler,He's got nothing!
11932,Chandler,What are you supporting?
11946,Chandler,"Monica, I think you've gone over to the bad place."
11958,Chandler,"They got a phone in there, right?"
11994,Chandler,Oh my God! That is so not the opposite of taking somebody's underwear!!
11999,Chandler,"Jeez, what a baby."
12045,Chandler,Excuse me. Hi.
12047,Chandler,"Well, your kind of sitting in my seat."
12049,Chandler,"I mean, I was sitting there."
12051,Chandler,"But, I never left the room!"
12053,Chandler,"All right, that's it, give me your underwear."
12067,Chandler,"Well, I'm sorry Joe. I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it just *fell* out of the socket."
12071,Chandler,Because the kids need new shoes.
12108,Chandler,Do I look fat?
12110,Chandler,"Okay, I accept that. When Janice asked me and I said no, she took that to mean that I was calling her a cow."
12112,Chandler,"Okay, well. Janice said 'Hi, do I look fat today?' And I, I looked at her...."
12116,Chandler,"Okay, so you both just know this stuff?"
12119,Chandler,"That's easy, baggage claim."
12121,Chandler,"Okay, this is good, this is good. All right listen, I have one. Janice likes to cuddle, at night, which, you know I'm all for. But, uh, you know when you want to go to sleep, you want some space. So, uh, how do I tell her that without, you know, accidentally calling her fat or something."
12127,Chandler,Thank you Rachel.
12131,Chandler,"Well, I thought you guys were cuddlily sleepers."
12137,Chandler,"Okay, the old hug and roll."
12139,Chandler,"Okay, one question."
12141,Chandler,You're pretending the pillow's a girl right?
12149,Chandler,"Umm, not feeling better 'bout Malcom."
12165,Chandler,"Well, your gonna need much bigger jars."
12173,Chandler,"That, that's what's stupid."
12194,Chandler,"No, that's all right. I just had a jar of mustard."
12196,Chandler,You mean there's more than one of us.
12212,Chandler,And that's how you bought it?
12226,Chandler,"Pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order."
12286,Chandler,Sure. What's up?
12296,Chandler,You're flingin'-flangin' right I am!
12299,Chandler,"Well, it's official there are no good movies."
12304,Chandler,"Hey, man. What's up?"
12306,Chandler,"Well, I'll tell ya I do enjoy guilt, but, ah, it wasn't me."
12322,Chandler,Is anybody else scared?
12324,Chandler,Get the woman a pad! Get the woman a pad! A pad! A pad!
12344,Chandler,"Okay, last night at dinner, when the meals came, she put half her chicken piccata on my plate and took my tomatoes."
12348,Chandler,"No, it's like all of the sudden, we were this couple. And this alarm started going off in my head: 'Run for your life! Get out of the building!'"
12354,Chandler,"Look what do I do? I wanna get past this, I don't wanna be afraid of the commitment thing. I wanna go through the tunnel, to the other side!"
12361,Chandler,"Yeah, Joe, I assure you if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun, I'm pretty much peeing every which way."
12383,Chandler,"Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because, you're my girlfriend, and that's what girlfriends should, should get."
12385,Chandler,"Well, not me. But that's what's happened, and, ah, and, and there's more. We should take a trip."
12387,Chandler,"Yep, we're a couple and that's what couples do. And, I wanna meet your parents. We should take a trip with your parents!"
12389,Chandler,"I am, I actually am. I mean this is amazing. My entire life I have feared this place, and now that I'm here it's like what was the big deal. I could probably say 'Let's move in together.' and I'd be okay."
12391,Chandler,It doesn't scare me!
12395,Chandler,"So, I finally catch up to her and she says this relationship is going to fast and we have to slow down."
12398,Chandler,Then I got all needy and clingy.
12400,Chandler,She said she'd call me.
12404,Chandler,This ice cream tastes like crap by the way.
12408,Chandler,"So, you don't think I'm terminal?"
12410,Chandler,"Okay, okay. So, should I call her?"
12415,Chandler,"So I'm not, not gonna lose her?"
12417,Chandler,"I said, 'So I'm not gonna lose her?'"
12451,Chandler,"Well, I'm sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as yours."
12453,Chandler,Here in Chelsea.
12459,Chandler,Can I be that guy?
12480,Chandler,"....And then I just, you know, threw the bag of barley at her, and ran out of the store."
12482,Chandler,"I've actually ruined this haven't I? It's time for the good ice cream now, right?"
12523,Chandler,Hey-hey-hey. So what happened? A forest tick you off?
12527,Chandler,YouÂ’re building a post office?
12541,Chandler,Does anyone else think David Copperfield is cute?
12543,Chandler,"All right, Janice, likes him. In fact she likes him so much she put him on her freebie list."
12545,Chandler,"Well, we have a deal, where we each get to pick five celebrities that we can sleep with, and the other one canÂ’t get mad."
12548,Chandler,"Ah, Kim Basinger, Cindy Crawford, Halle Berry, Yasmine Bleeth, and ah, Jessica Rabbit."
12550,Chandler,"I know, I know, I just always wondered if I could get her eyes to pop out of her head."
12580,Chandler,"We donÂ’t, really."
12584,Chandler,"You know, we donÂ’t really take advantage of living in the city."
12587,Chandler,"No, you didnÂ’t get me!! ItÂ’s an electric drill, you get me, you kill me!!"
12589,Chandler,I do NOT want this unit!!
12624,Chandler,"All right, so who do you got it narrowed down to?"
12626,Chandler,"Oooh-hoo, very attractive, forgiving."
12628,Chandler,"Eh, y'know what, sheÂ’s to political, she probably wouldnÂ’t let you do it, unless you donated four cans of food first."
12630,Chandler,"Ooh-hoo. Very hot, very sexy. But ah, y'know sheÂ’s too international, y'know sheÂ’s never gonna be around."
12632,Chandler,"So, you gotta play the odds, pick somebody whoÂ’s gonna be in the country like all the time."
12664,Chandler,WhatÂ’s going on?
12666,Chandler,Yo!! Spackel boy! Get up!
12668,Chandler,He started mine first!
12684,Chandler,"What, like a number?"
12733,Chandler,"Okay, on three. One....Two...."
12737,Chandler,"Yeah, I coulda counted to three like four times without all this Â‘twoÂ’ talk."
12746,Chandler,"Oh, good job Joe."
12748,Chandler,"Yeah-yeah, so big that it actually makes our doors look smaller!"
12793,Chandler,IÂ’ve got five bucks says you canÂ’t.
12795,Chandler,"Oh, I think I have the cash."
12827,Chandler,"IÂ’m never gonna find a roommate, ever."
12829,Chandler,"Well letÂ’s see, there was the guy with the ferrets, thatÂ’s plural. The spitter. Oh-ho, and yes, the guy that enjoyed my name so much he felt the need to make a little noise every time he said it. Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing Bing! Great apartment Chandler Bing, Bing!"
12831,Chandler,"Two. This photographer, who seemed really dull. And this actor guy, who IÂ’m not sure about, because when he called and I answered the phone Â‘Chandler Bing,Â’ he said Â‘Whoa-whoa, short message.Â’"
12836,Chandler,"Umm, howÂ’s it going with you guys?"
12840,Chandler,"Soo, ah, Eric, what kind of photography do ya do?"
12842,Chandler,"Yes, that is cool. Because I have models here y'know......never."
12847,Chandler,Sure. Ummm. WhatÂ’s up?
12849,Chandler,What gay thing?
12851,Chandler,"Well okay Jerry, thanks for stopping by."
12856,Chandler,Do I ever.
12860,Chandler,Just coffee! Where are we gonna hang out now?
12866,Chandler,"Um-mm, yeah right!"
12868,Chandler,"Oh yes, and thatÂ’s what I want a roommate that I can walk around with and be referred to as the funny one."
12870,Chandler,"Okay, but after that, weÂ’re shootinÂ’ some pool."
12883,Chandler,"Excuse, I seem to have dropped my ball."
12928,Chandler,"Oh, donÂ’t thank me, thank the jerk that never showed up. Okay, I gotta get to get to work."
12971,Chandler,"So ah, whatcha watching?"
12973,Chandler,WhatÂ’s it about?
12977,Chandler,Wow! Look at them run.
12979,Chandler,"Yeah, IÂ’ll go get one."
12983,Chandler,Do you have any beers? WeÂ’re out of beers.
12989,Chandler,"Noo!! You donÂ’t have a boyfriend because....I donÂ’t, I donÂ’t know why you donÂ’t have a boyfriend. You should have a boyfriend."
13004,Chandler,"Umm, this is nice."
13006,Chandler,"No, I mean it, this feels really good. Is it a hundred percent cotton?"
13008,Chandler,"Anyway, I should go, one of the lifeguards was just about to dismantle a nuclear device."
13039,Chandler,I canÂ’t believe you came back.
13051,Chandler,"If I was a superhero who could fly and be invisible, that would be the best."
13062,Chandler,What a wank!
13084,Chandler,"See, thatÂ’s why I could never be an actor. Because I canÂ’t say gig."
13220,Chandler,"Okay, well it this bed isnÂ’t new, how come there is plastic on the mattress?"
13227,Chandler,You told him to play the boxer gay!!
13229,Chandler,You totally screwed him over.
13288,Chandler,"Okay, IÂ’m not gonna have one."
13294,Chandler,See that is the problem with invisible dentists.
13297,Chandler,"That is so weird, because every time I go to the dentist, I look down the hygienistÂ’s blouse."
13363,Chandler,"Hey! Hold on a minute, hold on a second. Do you think these pearls are nice?"
13365,Chandler,"JaniceÂ’s birthday is coming up, I want to get her something speacial. Come in here with me."
13367,Chandler,"ThatÂ’s a good idea, Â‘Dear Janice have a Hubba-Bubba birthdayÂ’. I would like to get her something serious."
13373,Chandler,What is the thing?
13377,Chandler,"Well she, she wouldnÂ’t do that, sheÂ’s with, sheÂ’s with me."
13379,Chandler,"Yeah, well, youÂ’re wrong! Okay, youÂ’re wrong."
13402,Chandler,"Ah, I donÂ’t know, you tell me. Anything you ah, wanna tell me, because, if you ah, you should, if you, you would, tell me."
13404,Chandler,"You tell me! Maybe, itÂ’s because I was just fooling with my ex! Oh no-no-no-no, no-no-no-no, that was you!!"
13408,Chandler,"Joey told me, he saw you two kissing."
13410,Chandler,No! In his office! How many kisses were there?
13412,Chandler,"Wh-wh-why, wh-why, why, why was there kissing!? There should be no kissing!!"
13452,Chandler,I talked to Janice.
13454,Chandler,"She doesnÂ’t know. Says she loves us both. Y'know I woke up this morning and I was in love, well I was happy. Y'know it serves me right for buying that twelve pack of condoms. And now I canÂ’t even return them, because she choked on the reciept!"
13456,Chandler,"I donÂ’t know, y'know. What, what, would you do?"
13458,Chandler,"Come on, tell me."
13481,Chandler,"Janice, I have something I need to tell you, and I want you to let me get through it, because itÂ’s, itÂ’s, itÂ’s not gonna be easy."
13483,Chandler,"I think you should go back with Gary. I donÂ’t wanna be the guy that breaks up a family, y'know when my parents split up, it was because of that guy. Whenever I would see him I was always think y'know Â‘YouÂ’re the reason, you are the reason why their not together.Â’ and I hated that guy. And it didnÂ’t matter how nice he was, or how happy he made my Dad."
13485,Chandler,"Yeah, well. ItÂ’s the right thing to do."
13487,Chandler,Then donÂ’t leave me!
13489,Chandler,"Forget what I said, I was babbling! Pick me!"
13491,Chandler,"No you donÂ’t! No, no, no, I say you have to give your divorce another chance."
13493,Chandler,Ohhh. DonÂ’t go.
13495,Chandler,No. No! No! No!
13499,Chandler,You canÂ’t leave! I have your shoe!
13534,Chandler,"No, no, no, I donÂ’t, I donÂ’t really wanna play."
13536,Chandler,ThatÂ’s not true! I wanted to wear my bathrobe and eat peanut clusters all day. I wanted to start drinking in the morning. DonÂ’t say that I donÂ’t have goals!
13538,Chandler,"Yeah, all right, IÂ’ll play."
13547,Chandler,"No, no, no, you say that proudly."
13556,Chandler,And was the curse lifted?
13562,Chandler,"But wait a minute though, how are we gonna get there, though, because my Mom wonÂ’t let me cross the street."
13568,Chandler,And then Tineals.
13583,Chandler,Wow! Just like in the pros.
13598,Chandler,"Sorry. IÂ’m sorry. Y'know what, weÂ’re just gonna throw it."
13606,Chandler,"No, no, no, actually losers rhyme."
13613,Chandler,"Great! Now, the score is 7 to almost 7."
13623,Chandler,"No, no, no, no, no!"
13650,Chandler,"Well, that went well."
13652,Chandler,"Y'know, I was thinking about ah, asking her for her number."
13654,Chandler,"Whoa-ho, whoa! No, I was thinking about y'know for me, as a part of that whole getting over Janice thing you were talking about."
13656,Chandler,"Thanks. What, let me have her?! What do mean? Like if you didnÂ’t I wouldnÂ’t have a shot?"
13658,Chandler,"Math!! YouÂ’re giving me math! All right, look y'know what, forget about it, you go for the girl, weÂ’ll see who gets her."
13667,Chandler,"Well now you have two. Hey, I am good at math."
13669,Chandler,"Hey! Well, IÂ’ve been preparing for that my entire life! Or something about you thatÂ’s mean!"
13698,Chandler,Is everybody else seeing a troll doll nailed to a two by four?
13735,Chandler,"No-no-no-no, the gameÂ’s not over, weÂ’re just switching teams."
13738,Chandler,"No ah, hold on a second Joe, where do Dutch people come from?"
13740,Chandler,"And the other ah, Dutch people, they come on from somewhere near the Netherlands, right?"
13745,Chandler,Fine with me.
13753,Chandler,"Well, you donÂ’t you have Captain Hook explain it to her."
13760,Chandler,"Y'know what, it doesnÂ’t matter, Â‘cause she picked me. Me! From now on I get the dates and you have to stay home on Saturday nights watching Ready, Set, Cook!"
13762,Chandler,WeÂ’re not gonna lose to girls.
13784,Chandler,"Okay, okay, so we get to take that stupid troll thing home!"
13791,Chandler,"Hey-hey-hey Rachel, funny thing. Actually, the ah, end zone starts at that pole, so youÂ’re five feet short, so we win!"
13799,Chandler,"Yes. Yes, there is, they play on Sundays and Monday nights."
13813,Chandler,"Well, as old as he is in dog years, do you think Snoopy should still be allowed to fly this thing?"
13823,Chandler,"Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand."
13825,Chandler,I was shrieking... like a Marine.
13841,Chandler,"Yes. Yes, and ah, ah, the trees are happy too, because for most of them, itÂ’s the only chance to see New York."
13898,Chandler,"Ahh, do you have any coconut flavoured deities?"
13913,Chandler,"How... exactly are you pursuing that? Y'know other than sending out resumes like what, two years ago?"
13917,Chandler,"HeÂ’s right, if you quit this job, you then have motivation to go after a job you really want."
13919,Chandler,"Because, IÂ’m too afraid."
13921,Chandler,"Yeah, thatÂ’d be much worse than being 28, and still working here."
13932,Chandler,I spelled out boobies.
13940,Chandler,"So, how many have you sold so far?"
13942,Chandler,"Oh my God, how did you do that?"
13946,Chandler,Me! On my computer.
13948,Chandler,"Eh, yeah, well ah, waitress at a coffee shop and cheer squad co-captain only took up so much room."
13950,Chandler,Something else I might have said?
13954,Chandler,You-you-you donÂ’t wanna give into the fear.
14000,Chandler,"Tell us what happened, Brown Bird Ross."
14006,Chandler,"Y'know what Rach, maybe you should just, y'know stay here at the coffee house."
14009,Chandler,"Well seeing that drunk Santa wet himself, really perked up my Christmas."
14013,Chandler,ItÂ’s like Â‘Night of the Living Dead Christmas Trees.Â’
14015,Chandler,"Sure, everybody loves a kidder."
14028,Chandler,IÂ’m an alien. IÂ’m an alien.
14052,Chandler,I just saw Janice.
14054,Chandler,"Yeah, she was at Rockefeller Center skating with her husband, she looked so happy. I almost feel bad for whipping that kidÂ’s pretzel at them."
14056,Chandler,"Yes, but you ended up having sex with both of them that afternoon."
14059,Chandler,"Oh, y'know what, IÂ’m gonna be okay, you donÂ’t have to throw a party for me."
14061,Chandler,"Oh, well then, if anybody should have a party it should be him."
14063,Chandler,"Okay, well he totally screwed up the punch line. Y'know, itÂ’s supposed to be arrghh-eh og-errigh."
14105,Chandler,"Yeah, Jell-o just like Mom used to make."
14128,Chandler,Hi JoeyÂ’s sisters!
14135,Chandler,"Oh, IÂ’m taking my ex-girlfriend of my speed dialer."
14148,Chandler,"Well, my apartment isnÂ’t there anymore, because I drank it."
14151,Chandler,"Yeah, I ended up in the storage room, and not alone."
14153,Chandler,"Ow, no Â‘woo-hooing,Â’ no Â‘woo-hooing.Â’"
14157,Chandler,I canÂ’t remember which sister.
14160,Chandler,Okay! You donÂ’t think I thought of that?
14169,Chandler,"Veronica. Look, itÂ’s got to be Veronica, the girl in the red skirt. I definitely stuck my tongue down her throat."
14171,Chandler,"Look, when IÂ’ve been drinking, sometimes I tend to get overly friendly, and IÂ’m sorry."
14179,Chandler,"Why canÂ’t we talk in here? With, with, witnesses."
14187,Chandler,ItÂ’s gotta be the first one.
14189,Chandler,"Yep, IÂ’m in a tree."
14202,Chandler,"Well, thatÂ’s the part where you tell him that I moved to France. When actually IÂ’ll be in Cuba."
14204,Chandler,What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela?
14208,Chandler,IÂ’m here to see Mary-Angela.
14245,Chandler,"This teramisu is, is excellent. Did you make it Mary-Angela?"
14247,Chandler,"Well, itÂ’s, itÂ’s yummy. So Mary-Angela do you like it?"
14249,Chandler,"So um, Mary-Angela, whatÂ’s your second favorite?"
14251,Chandler,Would you just please....give me the receipt Â‘cause this is great. ItÂ’s top notch.
14253,Chandler,So will I.
14255,Chandler,Oh no-no-no I was just squinting. That doesnÂ’t mean anything.
14262,Chandler,"Ahhhh, youÂ’re not Mary-Angela."
14264,Chandler,"This is so bad. If-if youÂ’re not Mary-Angela, then-then who is?"
14268,Chandler,No Joey! No Joey! DonÂ’t Joey! Joey!
14278,Chandler,"Joey if you wanna punch me, go ahead, I deserve it. But I just want you to know that I would never soberly hurt you or your family, youÂ’re my best friend. I would never do anything like this ever again."
14328,Chandler,"Oh yeah, but don't worry. I don't think anybody's gonna focus on that as long as your wearing that towel dress."
14331,Chandler,"All right, I suppose I can wait a day. Hey, what are you doing Friday?"
14333,Chandler,"I need you to come to this bachelor party for my weird cousin Albert, y'know he's the botanist."
14335,Chandler,Yeah. Is that a dinosaur tie?
14350,Chandler,Well apparently Albert has no friends. He's very excited about the bachelor party though. I think actually the only reason he's getting married is so he can see a stripper.
14352,Chandler,"Well, if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks, then all right."
14356,Chandler,"I want to say you but, that seems like such an easy answer."
14362,Chandler,I'll get you the Cliff Notes.
14419,Chandler,....three years of modern dance with Twila Tharp! Five years with the American Ballet Theater?!
14423,Chandler,"Oh no, no, no, no."
14431,Chandler,"Okay, we have our stripper. A miss Crystal Chandelier."
14443,Chandler,"What, what, what?!"
14445,Chandler,You really think that is what he meant?
14473,Chandler,"Look, don't you see what's happening here. Instead of hitting on her right away, he's becoming her confidant. Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to complain about you."
14475,Chandler,"Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did that. All right look, you're going to have to go there yourself now, okay, make a few surprise visits."
14477,Chandler,"All right fine, don't do anything, just sit here and talk to us, meanwhile she is talking to him about you. And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.'"
14479,Chandler,He paints quite a picture doesn't he?
14533,Chandler,"Y'know what, I'm, I'm gonna spend some alone time with the pen."
14542,Chandler,"Oh, okay Ross. Listen, this pen is kinda getting boring, so can you pick me up some porn?"
14564,Chandler,"Yeah. Either that, or you just turned him on and sent him off to a stripper."
14600,Chandler,Making chocolate milk. Do you want some?
14631,Chandler,"Well, she spent the last six months getting over him, and now sheÂ’s celebrating that by going on a date with him."
14666,Chandler,"Right, right. Sometimes you guys just burst into flames."
14671,Chandler,"Okay Ross, why donÂ’t you come with me?"
14673,Chandler,RobertÂ’s coming out.
14675,Chandler,No. He.....heÂ’s coming out of his shorts.
14677,Chandler,The man is showing brain.
14685,Chandler,What do we do? What do we do?
14687,Chandler,Like an eclipse.
14706,Chandler,"Your liking it, huh?"
14710,Chandler,"No, actually LaurieÂ’s a boy."
14716,Chandler,You mean a three pointer?
14726,Chandler,"IÂ’m sorry, IÂ’m sorry, it just seems that Robert isnÂ’t as concealed in the shorts area, as ah, one may have hoped."
14751,Chandler,"Stretchy pants! Why, those are the greatest things in the world! If I were you I would wear them every day, every day!"
14762,Chandler,"Hmmm, thatÂ’s very cool."
14765,Chandler,I canÂ’t believe she cracked your code!
14772,Chandler,"No, Beth doesnÂ’t die, she doesnÂ’t die. Does she Rachel?"
14792,Chandler,"We canÂ’t tell him, you canÂ’t go up to a guy you barely know and talk about his.... stuff."
14801,Chandler,"Yeah, we got, um-hmm."
14846,Chandler,I like her.
14848,Chandler,"Well, thatÂ’s pretty much all IÂ’m looking for from these people."
14875,Chandler,No. This is just part of a dare devil game that I play called Â‘wait until the last moment before I burst and die.Â’
14880,Chandler,"Ginger. IÂ’m talking to Ginger, so...."
14934,Chandler,"Well, thatÂ’s the best kiss IÂ’ve had with anyone IÂ’ve ever met in a menÂ’s room."
14938,Chandler,"Yeah, weÂ’re gonna have to get you out of those shoes."
14940,Chandler,"No, really youÂ’re gonna freeze."
14942,Chandler,"YouÂ’re not, what do you, what do you got a bionic foot?"
14991,Chandler,"Oh, I hate that. I once had a thing of half and half, stole my car."
14993,Chandler,"Great. It was great. SheÂ’s ah, sheÂ’s great, great looking, great personality, sheÂ’s greatness."
14995,Chandler,"Joey told you about the leg, huh?"
14997,Chandler,"Oh God, it freaked me out. Okay, I know it shouldnÂ’t have, but it did. I mean I like her, I donÂ’t want to stop seeing her, but every so often itÂ’s like Â‘Hey, y'know what, whereÂ’s your leg?Â’ I mean IÂ’m the smallest person in the world arenÂ’t I? IÂ’m the smallest person in the world."
15001,Chandler,It came up.
15019,Chandler,"No. No. Actually I forgot, what is the deal with that again?"
15021,Chandler,No. No. I donÂ’t think so.
15024,Chandler,ThatÂ’s-thatÂ’s my nubbin.
15026,Chandler,"ItÂ’s kinda a ah, a third nipple kinda thing."
15030,Chandler,"You ah, you have, you have to leave, now? How come?"
15050,Chandler,"Oh yes! Just had me a little nubbin-ectomy. Yep! Two nipples, no waiting."
15054,Chandler,"That was an obvious joke, and I didnÂ’t think of it. Why didnÂ’t I think of it? The source of all my powers. Oh dear God, what have I done!"
15079,Chandler,"Okay listen, just give me anything I can make two of."
15082,Chandler,Yeah! You wanna come?
15084,Chandler,Come on Chloe! Finish up with your customer first. Come on Chloe! Come on Chloe!!
15091,Chandler,"Well ah, ........y'know."
15132,Chandler,"Hey, y'know what, maybe we should get going. I mean what time did Chloe say we should be there?"
15134,Chandler,What time is it now?
15136,Chandler,"Yeah all right, so weÂ’ll hang out."
15142,Chandler,"Yeah. Yeah, I mean what, what would we do?"
15144,Chandler,She was kidding.
15146,Chandler,"She was.... But y'know what, just in case, maybe we should come up with a set of ground rules."
15150,Chandler,"Right. Right. Well ah, y'know we could flip for it."
15152,Chandler,"Well it you donÂ’t know that, then I donÂ’t want to do this with you."
15211,Chandler,And thatÂ’s the only colour that comes in.
15214,Chandler,"So, what are you doing here? I thought tonight was your big anniversary dinner."
15251,Chandler,"Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out."
15253,Chandler,"Hey, this isnÂ’t like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!"
15254,Chandler,Y'know that whole swimming thing is a myth.
15256,Chandler,Why? What happened to him?
15387,Chandler,Oh my God! Oh my God!
15390,Chandler,"Well, before we answer that, I think we should address the more important question. How dumb are you?"
15393,Chandler,"HeÂ’s right. NobodyÂ’s gonna benefit, and youÂ’re just gonna hurt her."
15396,Chandler,"All right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait until the timingÂ’s right. And thatÂ’s what deathbeds are for."
15402,Chandler,"Okay, okay-okay, ah, Chloe works with that guy Issac. IssacÂ’s sister is Jasmine. And Jasmine works at that message place with Phoebe. And PhoebeÂ’s friends with Rachel. And thatÂ’s the trail, I did it!"
15467,Chandler,"Yeah, well I donÂ’t think you can make that statement, unless youÂ’ve been kicked in an area that God only meant to be treated nicely."
15470,Chandler,"Oh, thatÂ’s mature."
15488,Chandler,"Yeah, well, I guess they had a fight, and he got drunk...."
15503,Chandler,She was not good. Not good.
15512,Chandler,"Yeah, never cheat on Rachel."
15530,Chandler,"Y'know what, I think we can go out there. I mean they have more important things to worry about."
15548,Chandler,"Oh great, food with hair on it."
15550,Chandler,Because that would be crazy?
15560,Chandler,"Yeah, come on, itÂ’s Ross and Rachel, theyÂ’ve got too."
15565,Chandler,Are you actually saying these words?
15592,Chandler,This is the New York Times.
15595,Chandler,We are. HeÂ’s meeting us here.
15601,Chandler,"Yeah y-you, how hard is it to say something? Rachel came over to borrow something."
15606,Chandler,"Y'know what this is like? This is like when my parents got divorced. Man, I hope Ross doesnÂ’t try to kidnap me after Cub Scouts."
15611,Chandler,"Y'know what maybe itÂ’s gonna be okay, I mean itÂ’s been a week."
15629,Chandler,"Yes, yes, itÂ’s just that we ah, we kinda all ready, made plans with Ross."
15633,Chandler,"Yeah, heÂ’s really excited about it too, he even recorded show times on his answering machine."
15648,Chandler,"Well, actually, yesterday I was smoking again. Today, IÂ’m, IÂ’m smoking still."
15650,Chandler,"Look, IÂ’m telling you this is just like my parents divorce, which is when I started smoking in the first place."
15652,Chandler,"Yeahhh. IÂ’m tellinÂ’ ya something, that ah, first smoke after nap time...."
15653,Chandler,"Oh thatÂ’s great, with my luck, thatÂ’s gonna be him."
15659,Chandler,"Hey, shut up!! YouÂ’re not my real Mom!!"
15663,Chandler,Can somebody else hug him? I have to stay by the window.
15679,Chandler,"Well, then, I might as well offer to stay."
15687,Chandler,Beam me up Jesus.
15689,Chandler,"Okay, well, then, I-I have to go to the bathroom."
15693,Chandler,"Oh, come on, thereÂ’s a rest stop right up there! Come on, I really have to goooooooooo."
15695,Chandler,"Here we go. Okay, brace yourselves."
15709,Chandler,"Oh I do! Op, no, wait a minute, I took it out of my shirt when I put it on this morning."
15724,Chandler,"Ladies, ladies, letÂ’s just compromise okay? Phoebe, Rachel take off MonicaÂ’s bra."
15727,Chandler,"Well, I thought if I littered, that crying Indian might come by and save us."
15730,Chandler,"Okay, now letÂ’s decide who has the nicest ass."
15734,Chandler,At least let me smoke it to the good part.
15779,Chandler,Well itÂ’s very unsettling.
15815,Chandler,"Oh no, now itÂ’s not gonna make any sense!"
15817,Chandler,"Oh, this is horrible, itÂ’s just horrible."
15831,Chandler,"Y'know what, I can handle it, handleÂ’s my middle name. Actually itÂ’s the ah, middle part of my first name."
15870,Chandler,I was being Shelly Winters from The Poseidon Adventure.
15890,Chandler,Oh come on man! At least let me finish this last one.
15894,Chandler,"No-no, why donÂ’t you hang on to that one."
15895,Chandler,"Okay, thatÂ’s like the least fun game ever."
15906,Chandler,Or what my Father called Thursday night.
15930,Chandler,"Y'know, I wouldÂ’ve bet good money that heÂ’d be the first one of us to get married."
15936,Chandler,Always illegal Joe.
15945,Chandler,"If that doesnÂ’t keep kids in school, what will?"
15987,Chandler,"Y'know, I forgot the combination to this about a year ago? I just carry it around. Do you have any Chap Stick?"
15990,Chandler,"Y'know what, pretty good."
15992,Chandler,"Good! I havenÂ’t smoked yet today, I feel great, and-and-and confident, that is a stunning blouse."
15997,Chandler,What check thing?
16001,Chandler,WhoÂ’s he hugginÂ’?
16003,Chandler,This guy invented Moss 865! Every office in the world uses that program!
16005,Chandler,There you go!!
16092,Chandler,"Okay, okay, just because he buys you dinner, does not mean you owe him anything."
16094,Chandler,"Okay, then get the lobster!"
16145,Chandler,"Mr. Millionaire, new from Snooty Playthings! Third wife sold separately."
16149,Chandler,Life-sized Imperial Storm Troopers from Sharper Image?
16151,Chandler,Wow!! Can Joey and I put them on and fight?
16155,Chandler,"Yeah, either that, or Gloria Estefan was right, eventually, the rhythm is going to get you."
16228,Chandler,And youÂ’re our age. YouÂ’re our age.
16233,Chandler,ThatÂ’s not a state Joe.
16237,Chandler,YouÂ’re our age!
16255,Chandler,Is there any chance you didnÂ’t see that?
16256,Chandler,Ross! You gotta stop! Okay?! You canÂ’t just stare through the peep hole for three hours! YouÂ’re gonna get peep eye!
16258,Chandler,You didnÂ’t just break up.
16260,Chandler,You slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up. I mean bullets have left guns slower!
16264,Chandler,And the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave.
16268,Chandler,No!! You canÂ’t!!
16276,Chandler,"SheÂ’s moving on! Okay, if itÂ’s not this guy, itÂ’s gonna be somebody else! And unless youÂ’re thinking about subletting my peep hole, you are going to have to get used to the fact that the relationship is over! Okay, man? ItÂ’s over."
16316,Chandler,"Ah, Sliced Bread, a wonderful Lady MacBeth."
16318,Chandler,I think somebody has a crush on somebody.
16320,Chandler,"IÂ’m talking about you. You big, big freak."
16322,Chandler,"Hey, you have nothing but talk about her for the last 48 hours! If you were in a school yard youÂ’d be pulling her pigtails and pushing her down now!"
16346,Chandler,Â‘Cause itÂ’s-itÂ’s not his last name.
16348,Chandler,"No, itÂ’s not like, like Phil Spiderman. HeÂ’s a spider, man. Y'know like ah, like Goldman is a last name, but thereÂ’s no Gold Man."
16357,Chandler,"So, ahh, what kind of powers would Gold Man have?"
16359,Chandler,What about things that are already gold?
16361,Chandler,"Okay, letÂ’s play my game now."
16363,Chandler,"Wait a minute, wait. YouÂ’re telling me this actress person is the only woman you ever wanted who didnÂ’t want you back?!"
16384,Chandler,My Grandmother used to say that exact same thing to me.
16392,Chandler,"Yes, I realise that."
16398,Chandler,"Thanks, itÂ’s ah, Gaelic, for Â‘Thy turkeyÂ’s done.Â’ So ah, IÂ’m gonna go, nice, nice meeting you."
16434,Chandler,"Oh, I'm glad you guys are past that little awkward phase."
16436,Chandler,"Oh-ho, liked what she saw, huh? Dug my action, did she? CheckinÂ’ out the Chan-Chan man!"
16438,Chandler,"Yeah, she seemed cool, attractive. IÂ’ll do it."
16487,Chandler,"Well, the movie was great, dinner was great, and thereÂ’s nothing like a cool, crisp New York evening."
16489,Chandler,"Of course, I didnÂ’t get to enjoy any of that, because JoannaÂ’s such a big, dull dud!"
16552,Chandler,ThatÂ’s what you say at the end of a date.
16554,Chandler,"To her face? Look itÂ’s the end of the date, IÂ’m standing there, I know all sheÂ’s waiting for is for me to say Â‘IÂ’ll call herÂ’ and itÂ’s just y'know, comes out. I canÂ’t help it, itÂ’s a compulsion."
16570,Chandler,"Multiple, so many paper cuts."
16574,Chandler,"Look, you canÂ’t call somebody after this long just to say, Â‘In case you didnÂ’t notice, I donÂ’t like you!Â’"
16576,Chandler,Nooo!! SheÂ’s really dull! And she gets this gross mascara goop thing in the corner of her eye!
16578,Chandler,"All right! Fine! But itÂ’s just a lunch date, no more than an hour! And from now on I get my own dates, I donÂ’t want you setting me up with anybody ever again!"
16580,Chandler,"ThatÂ’s just a lot of big talk, y'know."
16614,Chandler,"The food there was, was great."
16616,Chandler,So take care.
16624,Chandler,"Look, IÂ’m sorry. Okay? IÂ’m weak, and pathetic, and sorry."
16626,Chandler,AhhhhÂ—IÂ’m not going to call you.
16632,Chandler,Well this is great! IÂ’ll give you a call! We should do it again sometime!
16652,Chandler,Oh my God! WhoÂ’s gonna watch that?!
16698,Chandler,"So um, after you put the suggestion in the box, how long did it take for the roller skating thing to happen."
16700,Chandler,"Okay, so I guess thatÂ’s about ah, two weeks before the topless thing kicks in."
16707,Chandler,Fowl? No. Women? Nooo.
16748,Chandler,I stayed home from work today while you were at rehearsal so somebody could be here with our chick!
16750,Chandler,You donÂ’t think I get up when you get up?
16752,Chandler,"Yes, here it comes! IÂ’m stuck here all day, and then you come in and spend two seconds with us and then expect to go off gallivanting with your friends? Well I donÂ’t think so mister!"
16754,Chandler,And you donÂ’t think taking care of our chick is work?
16758,Chandler,IÂ’ll take her back tomorrow.
16897,Chandler,"I know. See, yes. ThatÂ’s Yasmine Bleeth, sheÂ’s a completely different kind of chick. I love you both. But in very different ways."
16901,Chandler,"I did! But the store wouldnÂ’t take her back! So then I took her to the shelter, and you know what I found out?"
16902,Chandler,"If they canÂ’t find a home for her, they kill her! And IÂ’m not gonna let that happen to little Yasmine!"
16904,Chandler,Okay. And itÂ’s not just chicks y'know? ItÂ’s all kinds of other animals!
16906,Chandler,"Thanks, IÂ’m glad you see it that way."
16907,Chandler,"Ohhh-hoo, funny story!"
16932,Chandler,"Okay! Now you stay out here, and you think about what you did!!"
16957,Chandler,Having a swim.
16959,Chandler,Chicks donÂ’t swim.
16961,Chandler,I donÂ’t know. Should we try it?
16981,Chandler,WhoÂ’s number two? One of the more difficult games sewer workers play.
16999,Chandler,"Yeah, and I donÂ’t have any cologne."
17001,Chandler,Oh! Worm medicine for the duck.
17018,Chandler,Okay. I just wanted them to hear it from somebody else.
17057,Chandler,Almost as good as that play with the two naked girls on the see-saw.
17063,Chandler,So thatÂ’s the girl you like.
17066,Chandler,"Wait a minute, wait a minute, you donÂ’t like the guy RachelÂ’s dating? Well, thatÂ’s odd."
17081,Chandler,Could I borrow it?
17166,Chandler,"Ross, donÂ’t. Ross!"
17184,Chandler,"Ohh, thatÂ’s a good one."
17199,Chandler,"Why donÂ’t you use ours across the hall, Â‘cause sheÂ…hasÂ…problems."
17209,Chandler,Step away from the duck.
17235,Chandler,"And yet, sheÂ’s still not hanging up the phone."
17246,Chandler,Was it like a sneeze only better?
17257,Chandler,"No, it's... fancier than a pimple. Look Ross, why don't you just go see a"
17259,Chandler,"Okay, well, it's definite, two more weeks of winter."
17271,Chandler,"Well, y'know if Joey and I played with matches we could get you up to an even hundred."
17273,Chandler,"You're right, I know."
17290,Chandler,"Y'know what? You should go to my guy, because when I went in there with my third nipple. He just lopped it right off. Y'know? So I guess I'm lucky. I mean not as lucky as people who were born with two nipples."
17323,Chandler,"Well, if he's gonna break up with you, maybe Joey and I should water his plants. If y'know what I mean."
17335,Chandler,"Well sensitive is important, pick him."
17372,Chandler,"So, what do you thing the good news is?"
17381,Chandler,"Yes, but this is Pete. Okay? HeÂ’s not like other people, on your first date he took you to Rome. For most guys thatÂ’s like a third or fourth date kinda thing."
17386,Chandler,"Oh, so youÂ’re going with the teacher, huh?"
17543,Chandler,"Yeah, itÂ’s two guys in a ring, and the rules are: Â“TheyÂ’re are no rules.Â”"
17550,Chandler,"Yes, but thereÂ’s two in martini, soo everybody back to my office."
17552,Chandler,"Oh itÂ’s Bing, sir. IÂ’m sorry , I was just ah..."
17558,Chandler,"Thank you! Today, my boss keep slapping my butt and he was acting like it was no big deal."
17560,Chandler,"Well, I didnÂ’t do anything. I didnÂ’t want to be the guy who has a problem with his boss slapping his bottom."
17564,Chandler,"Yeah, I know, for a really great stew you just y'know, stick your head in between Â‘em."
17619,Chandler,"Well, thatÂ’s not true, he-he smacked you once."
17668,Chandler,"Nine times! Okay, I had to put on lotion! But, itÂ’s gonna be okay, because as of tomorrow IÂ’m conducting an experiment, and if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack free."
17672,Chandler,"No, I ah, I didnÂ’t do them."
17674,Chandler,"No, no I just ah, didnÂ’t do them. Instead, I ah, hung out with a couple of friends and had a couple of beers so I certainly donÂ’t deserve any praise, verbal or otherwise."
17678,Chandler,IÂ’m a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you express yourself.
17680,Chandler,"No, no. It-itÂ’s not about the swearing, itÂ’s more about ah, the way, that you ah, occasionally, concentrate, your enthusiasm on my buttock."
17682,Chandler,"Oh, and donÂ’t get me wrong, I appreciate the sentiment. ItÂ’s just that I, I have a rather, sensitive posterior, and ah, besides, itÂ’s making all the other guys jealous."
17723,Chandler,"Thank you, sir."
17726,Chandler,"No. No, not at all, thatÂ’s-thatÂ’s ridiculous."
17728,Chandler,"Ye-ye-yeah, yes I do!"
17731,Chandler,"Run! Run you crazy, rich freak!"
17764,Chandler,"YouÂ’re not gonna die an old maid, maybe an old spinster cook."
17766,Chandler,"Hey now besides, if worst comes to worst, IÂ’ll be your boyfriend."
17768,Chandler,Why is that so funny?
17770,Chandler,"Ha-ha-ha. A little to hard. What am I not ah, boyfriend material?"
17785,Chandler,"What a minute, I know that hat! I was taken aboard that hat! They did experiments on me! I canÂ’t have children!!"
17790,Chandler,"Buy it for ya, or win it for ya?"
17846,Chandler,Bored and bored!
17869,Chandler,"Okay, umm, we all have to play strip poker."
17902,Chandler,"So, you still donÂ’t think IÂ’m boyfriend material?"
17904,Chandler,I saw you checking me out during the game last night.
17906,Chandler,"Yeah, well, lucky for you."
17908,Chandler,I donÂ’t know.
17913,Chandler,"Oh, yeah, I donÂ’t know what they were doing, but at one point sea turtles actually came up to the house."
17947,Chandler,Where ya going?
18010,Chandler,"Okay, then you gotta back away, all right? You donÂ’t need that kindÂ’ve hurt. Take it from a guy whoÂ’s never had a long term relationship......"
18015,Chandler,"Oh, ahh, no thanks, I just had an M&M."
18020,Chandler,There is not one hair on that head.
18028,Chandler,"Okay! Okay! Let me try it again, youÂ’re gonna wanna date this next guy, I swear!"
18081,Chandler,I found a dried up seashores.
18111,Chandler,"All right, thereÂ’s a nuclear holocaust, IÂ’m the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?"
18113,Chandler,IÂ’ve got canned goods.
18115,Chandler,"Excellent hole, Joe."
18120,Chandler,"Well, can we help?! You want us to take you back to the house?!"
18124,Chandler,WeÂ’ve got to do something!
18130,Chandler,"Y'know what, heÂ’s right. ThereÂ’s something like uh, ammonia in that, that like kills the pain."
18146,Chandler,"Oh my God! If you say that one more time, IÂ’m gonna break up with you!"
18149,Chandler,"Look, Ross, you have what you want, youÂ’re back with Rachel. If you bring this up now youÂ’re gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you."
18174,Chandler,IÂ’ll give you a thousand dollars to talk to us.
18189,Chandler,And then Joey remembered something.
18243,Chandler,I KNEW IT!!!!
18245,Chandler,"We were playing Gin? Y'know if we were a couple, we could play this game naked."
18247,Chandler,Okay. All right.
18249,Chandler,Wow! That ripped! That ripped real nice!
18251,Chandler,"You donÂ’t turn and slide, you throw it out! IÂ’m tired of having to get a tetanus shot every time I get dressed!"
18253,Chandler,"All right, how about we, how Â‘bout we sell it."
18279,Chandler,"Uh-huh, first you tell us where you got the prettiest lace in all the land."
18286,Chandler,You want it?
18288,Chandler,"Ahh, Gepeto, $5,000 dollars? Are you insane?"
18290,Chandler,"All right look, IÂ’m changing it to 50 bucks, or your best offer."
18294,Chandler,I canÂ’t believe you donÂ’t know what I do for a living!
18330,Chandler,"Yes, Joey has a very careful screening process. Apparently, not everyone is qualified to own wood and nails."
18348,Chandler,"YouÂ’ll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this."
18350,Chandler,"Y'know, I, I really donÂ’t think we need a canoe."
18352,Chandler,"All right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you get home, throw the canoe away!"
18367,Chandler,"Y'know what, I think this might be one of the times heÂ’s wrong."
18369,Chandler,"Oh-no, heÂ’s right."
18382,Chandler,IÂ’m coming already!!
18414,Chandler,OH MY GOD!!!
18416,Chandler,Are you all right?!
18420,Chandler,What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell is all of our stuff?!!
18422,Chandler,SoÂ—You got in voluntarily?!
18438,Chandler,"Oh, umm, Joey was born, and then 28 years later, I was robbed!!"
18448,Chandler,"Oh, they said uh, Â“You donÂ’t have insurance here, so stop calling us.Â”"
18476,Chandler,"Oh no-no-no, IÂ’m, IÂ’m paddling away!"
18478,Chandler,Wow! Really?! We get all this rusty crap for free?!
18480,Chandler,Could we be more white trash?
18490,Chandler,"Hey uh, Rach, funny story. I ah, bumped into Joanna on the street yesterday."
18492,Chandler,"Well, no, actually she uh, asked me if I wanted to get a drink."
18496,Chandler,"Well, not at first."
18499,Chandler,"Well, I think I judged her too quickly, and this time we were able to take the relationship to the next level."
18501,Chandler,"Oh, come on! ItÂ’s not like this is an everyday occurrence for me! I mean usually IÂ’m pretty much just in there by myself."
18503,Chandler,"Okay, I promise, IÂ’ll end it."
18505,Chandler,"I hope you know what IÂ’m giving up for ya, because sheÂ’s not just the boss in your office, if you know what I mean."
18559,Chandler,It just doesnÂ’tÂ…feel like weÂ’re breaking up.
18567,Chandler,IÂ’m getting dressed.
18569,Chandler,When I walk outside naked people throw garbage at me.
18571,Chandler,What is it?
18575,Chandler,"You are, youÂ’re gonna leave me like this?"
18590,Chandler,"Look, this isnÂ’t funny! You get back here right now!"
18598,Chandler,"Okay, hereÂ’s the situation. The keys to the cuffs are on the back of the door. Could you be a doll and grab them and scoot on over and unlock me? And on a totally different subject, that is a lovely pantsuit."
18600,Chandler,"I did break up with her! She just took it really, really well!"
18602,Chandler,"It did enter my mind! But then something happened that made it, shoot right out."
18610,Chandler,IÂ—never borrowed your Walkman.
18618,Chandler,"IÂ’ll make something up! IÂ’m good at lying, I actually did borrow your Walkman!"
18620,Chandler,"Oh-ho-ho, I donÂ’t think so!"
18621,Chandler,"Well, this is much better."
18645,Chandler,"Hey, look, youÂ’re in trouble either way! Okay? If she comes back and sees me locked to this instead of the chair, sheÂ’s gonna know you were in here. So you might as well just let me go."
18669,Chandler,With extra pulp?
18673,Chandler,You donÂ’t have it.
18675,Chandler,How do Monica and Phoebe know?
18679,Chandler,And Milton Berle has a
18707,Chandler,I think so.
18719,Chandler,Could there be more Kims?
18729,Chandler,"Yeah, it was time. The old condom ring in the leather just doesnÂ’t say Â‘coolÂ’ anymore."
18758,Chandler,"Oh yeah, gym member. I try to go four times a week, but IÂ’ve missed the last 1200 times."
18760,Chandler,"You donÂ’t think IÂ’ve tried? You think I like having 50 dollars taken out of my bank account every month? No, they make you go all the way down there! Then they use all of these phrases and peppiness to try and confuse you! Then they bring out Maria."
18762,Chandler,"Oh Maria. You canÂ’t say no to her, sheÂ’s like this lycra spandex covered gymÂ…treat."
18766,Chandler,"Oh no, youÂ’ll have to come."
18782,Chandler,Why donÂ’t you just give him to somebody else?
18786,Chandler,Because thatÂ’s the only part of you he can see when heÂ’s on the table!
18807,Chandler,No! I want a flabby gut and saggy man breasts!
18811,Chandler,I wanna quit the gym.
18855,Chandler,"No, I almost did, couldnÂ’t leave Ross there without a spotter!"
18859,Chandler,"WeÂ’re doomed. Okay, theyÂ’re gonna take 50 bucks out of our accounts for the rest of our lives. What are we gonna do?"
18862,Chandler,YouÂ’re a genius!
18864,Chandler,"Now, thereÂ’s two reasons."
18874,Chandler,"Thank you, Joey."
18908,Chandler,"No, weÂ’d just like to close them."
18911,Chandler,I wanna quit the bank!
18933,Chandler,To pay for the gym.
18976,Chandler,"Ohh, she's pretty. Pretty ahh, pretty girl, the pretty--she's pretty."
18978,Chandler,I could die.
18981,Chandler,I tell people secrets. It makes them like me.
18986,Chandler,"All right, I'm gonna do it! I'm gonna get shot down. Any advice?"
18992,Chandler,"Uh Kathy, with K or a C?"
18996,Chandler,"Hey, come on, give me a break, I'm out on a limb here."
19001,Chandler,"Yes-yes, I was just trying to figure out a way to uh, demonstrate how I could get my exceptionally large feet into my even bigger mouth."
19006,Chandler,"Jeez, at 2:30 in the morning, I didn't expect to have to fight over the remote."
19008,Chandler,Oh my God! That's why I got up too!
19010,Chandler,"Hey, listen, I'm sorry about this afternoon, y'know, if I would've known you guys were... I never would've..."
19012,Chandler,"So ah, Joey tells me you two met in acting class."
19014,Chandler,"That's a good thing actually, because ah, he used to have me rehearse with him."
19016,Chandler,Is it on?
19020,Chandler,Oh! It's on! It's on!
19021,Chandler,There we go little fella.
19023,Chandler,Well the duck can swim.
19036,Chandler,"Oh yeah, me too, she's so cool and pretty."
19038,Chandler,"She's smart and funny, y'know? We were up all last night talking, she said the funniest thing about--what?"
19040,Chandler,"No, I don't."
19043,Chandler,"Thank you, Ross."
19097,Chandler,"Oh, I just wanted to say, ""Hey!"""
19121,Chandler,"Ohh, umm, y'know what, I already ate."
19123,Chandler,"Y'know I had a big meal on Monday, y'know. So that's just gonna get me straight through the week."
19127,Chandler,You got me.
19154,Chandler,"Ohh, she's-she's not really my type."
19156,Chandler,Y'know what I think it is? It's the fishnet stockings. Y'know? Whenever I see a girl in fishnet stockings it reminds me of my father in fishnet stockings.
19158,Chandler,"Uhh, no-no thanks."
19164,Chandler,"Hey, look, what do you want from me?"
19166,Chandler,I am pretending.
19193,Chandler,Can I sleep on your couch?
19208,Chandler,Ross and the most beautiful girl in the world.
19215,Chandler,"Okay, but that's, like, the easiest era."
19219,Chandler,Hi. You guys have any wrapping paper?
19221,Chandler,"Phebes, it was your birthday, like, months ago."
19223,Chandler,"Well, I have a call in about that."
19225,Chandler,"Actually, this is for Kathy's birthday. It's an early edition of her favorite book."
19227,Chandler,"Okay, but don't touch it, because you fingers have destructive oils."
19229,Chandler,"Oh, it wasn't a big deal. I just went to a couple of bookstores, talked to a couple of dealers... called a couple of the author's grandchildren."
19232,Chandler,It doesn't say that. Does it?
19234,Chandler,"Okay, all right, I'll just uh, make sure that uh, Joey gets her something really great."
19298,Chandler,"I don't know... um, Grease?"
19302,Chandler,"Okay, so when do you want to go?"
19305,Chandler,"Yes, it is, at Office Max."
19309,Chandler,Huh-huh! You can't give her that.
19311,Chandler,Because she's not eleven! And it's not the seventh night of Hanukkah!
19314,Chandler,"All right, look, look. What did... what did you get for Angela Delveccio for her birthday?"
19316,Chandler,For three years?
19318,Chandler,"All right. I will go out and I will try to find something for her, okay?"
19320,Chandler,Would you like me to write her a little poem as well?
19352,Chandler,"Okay, all right. I just spent the entire afternoon looking for a present for Kathy that would be better than the rabbit."
19356,Chandler,"She's really going to love this, you know? The bottom line is I want her to have it, even if I don't get to be the one who gives it to her."
19358,Chandler,Yeah? You don't think it's just pathetic?
19365,Chandler,"No, it's a book that's just a book, okay? It's an early edition of the Velveteen Rabbit. It was her favorite book as a kid. So, uh, just... let me know if she likes it, okay?"
19367,Chandler,"No, it came out to an even twenty."
19406,Chandler,"Hey, how'd it go? How'd she like the gift?"
19408,Chandler,Oh yeah? That's great!
19410,Chandler,"[nodding, with mixed feelings] Aahhuuhhh.... [Kathy enters]"
19413,Chandler,Hey! Happy birthday.
19416,Chandler,No he didn't. [Moving it back.
19418,Chandler,Happy birthday! I'm sorry.
19420,Chandler,"See, you think it's just a pen, but then you turn it over and it's also a clock."
19422,Chandler,"Oh, yeah... yeah."
19426,Chandler,[to Kathy] Goodnight.
19428,Chandler,"Oh, uh, yeah... I just knew that sometimes when you're writing, you... you don't always know the exact time."
19430,Chandler,"Uh, the book?"
19432,Chandler,What do you mean?
19436,Chandler,"Oh, yeah, he's my... he's my best friend."
19458,Chandler,Wait! YouÂ’re going out with Kathy!
19462,Chandler,"Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that sheÂ’s-sheÂ’s smart, and funny, and gets you."
19464,Chandler,"All right look, I think itÂ’s time for you to settle down. Y'know? Make a choice, pick a lane."
19481,Chandler,"All right! Bring it on, you"
19493,Chandler,"You mean like, music?"
19494,Chandler,"Yeah, I know what youÂ’re thinkinÂ’! Yes, yes, your breasts are just as firm and juicy."
19497,Chandler,"Uh yes, but uh, I just watch it for the articles."
19499,Chandler,"No-no, heÂ’s not back yet, but heÂ’ll be here any minute. So uh, come on in. Have a seat. Bow or stern?"
19505,Chandler,Why canÂ’t you tell her?
19509,Chandler,I thought your time ran out.
19513,Chandler,"So I guess itÂ’s just uh, you and me then."
19515,Chandler,"Yeah, I think it is!"
19517,Chandler,"Oh, I had an appointment to get my haircut"
19519,Chandler,and then it got canceled.
19521,Chandler,Really?! You do that?
19523,Chandler,"Dog grooming huh? Okay, just donÂ’t make my tail too poofy."
19527,Chandler,What-what Â‘cha doinÂ’?
19533,Chandler,Hey itÂ’s Joey!
19541,Chandler,Yeah. Yes! Yeah.
19545,Chandler,"No-no-no-no, this is bad! ItÂ’s bad! This is bad!"
19547,Chandler,"Wait the uh, the kiss or the situation?"
19551,Chandler,"Ooh! Yes! Okay! HereÂ’s what we do, we-we forget it happened."
19553,Chandler,"Okay, we-we swallow our feelings. Even if it means weÂ’re unhappy forever. Sound good?"
19555,Chandler,"I have to; heÂ’s my best friend, and youÂ’re seeing him."
19559,Chandler,I-I think we have too.
19580,Chandler,I sure did.
19582,Chandler,"Well, I just thought itÂ’d make me feel good to do something nice for my friend."
19586,Chandler,"Well, yÂ’know IÂ’m 29. I mean who needs a savings account."
19588,Chandler,"Oh, I donÂ’t know."
19590,Chandler,You mean with Casey.
19594,Chandler,Could be Casey.
19598,Chandler,That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place!
19610,Chandler,I kissed Kathy.
19614,Chandler,"No. Is there anyway, anyway you think heÂ’ll understand this?"
19617,Chandler,"Oh, donÂ’t say that! DonÂ’t say that. ThatÂ’s not true. Is it?"
19620,Chandler,Then why didnÂ’t you tell me to do that?!!
19627,Chandler,Why?! Why do I have to tell him?!
19629,Chandler,"Yeah, I know."
19633,Chandler,Is that a real thing?
19635,Chandler,"Listen ah, Joe, I-I need to, I need to talk to you about something."
19637,Chandler,"ItÂ’s-itÂ’s about Kathy. Umm, uh, I like her. I like her a lot actually."
19643,Chandler,"Oh uh, when?"
19645,Chandler,"Oh man, I am so sorry. Are, are you okay?"
19647,Chandler,"Yes, but I-I uh, donÂ’t have too."
19651,Chandler,"Well, I thought that would be the best thing to do."
19653,Chandler,"See uh, thatÂ’s-thatÂ’s actually what I wanted to talk to you about. I-I think I know who the other guy is."
19655,Chandler,ItÂ’s me. IÂ’m the other guy.
19657,Chandler,"Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking, and one thing to another and"
19659,Chandler,No! No! No! I just kissed her.
19661,Chandler,How is that worse?!
19663,Chandler,"Look, IÂ’m sorry! But thereÂ’s nothing I can do, I think IÂ’m in love with her!"
19665,Chandler,"YouÂ’re right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line."
19667,Chandler,Yes. Yes! Right! And I feel horrible. You have to believe me!
19692,Chandler,"They couldnÂ’t be worse. I spent eight hours calling him last night, just trying to get him to talk to me."
19701,Chandler,"Hey, by any chance did either of pick uh Rachel for your secret Santa, Â‘cause I wanna trade for her."
19703,Chandler,Wow! Why do you want to get rid of her so badly?
19708,Chandler,"Op, y'know what though, itÂ’s kindÂ’ve a girlie briefcase."
19710,Chandler,"Hey, what time is it? The big game is about to start!"
19717,Chandler,"Monica got ice in her eye, and it hurts."
19720,Chandler,Well maybe you should put some ice on it.
19724,Chandler,HeÂ’s really picky about his patients.
19736,Chandler,"Oh yÂ’know what, I was already trying to trade for ah, well, you."
19738,Chandler,"I donÂ’t know R.G., I was thinking something girlie for your office."
19740,Chandler,"Oh no-no-no, you donÂ’t want to do that, then youÂ’re gonna get stuck with Rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets."
19744,Chandler,When was the last time you saw her wear it?
19768,Chandler,"I walk into a room and he wonÂ’t even talk to me, he just mumbles something in Italian. And I know he only knows the bad words."
19783,Chandler,"Oh, uh, when-when are you coming back?"
19787,Chandler,"Hey, look, what do you want me to say? Do you want me to say that IÂ’ll stop seeing her?"
19789,Chandler,"Hey, look, I know what it is to be a friend, I just-I just screwed up!"
19791,Chandler,"All right look, if youÂ’re not gonna stay for me, then at least stay for them! Okay, they have had a very difficult year! What with the robbery and all!"
19860,Chandler,How do ya do.
19864,Chandler,What happened? What happened?!
19884,Chandler,"Okay, okay, you got it!"
19891,Chandler,"You canÂ’t tell, but IÂ’m trying to break the tension by mooning you guys!"
19893,Chandler,"YouÂ’re right, and IÂ’m sorry! This means a lot to me! I want you to be my friend again! I swear, I wonÂ’t say another word tonight."
19940,Chandler,"Man, this is"
19952,Chandler,Our eyes are closed and weÂ’re about to cross the street. Very good.
19974,Chandler,"No-no, I donÂ’t think you heard me. Are you ready to party?!"
19976,Chandler,"KathyÂ’s with her parents, I have nothing to do, so tomorrow we are partying with Gandolf dude!"
19980,Chandler,IÂ’m gonna call and get off work tomorrow!
19982,Chandler,"This is gonna be soo cool, dude, we never party anymore!"
20004,Chandler,Oh man! I am so excitedÂ—I may vomit!
20006,Chandler,"Look you donÂ’t understand, Gandolf is amazing. YÂ’know youÂ’re never know whatÂ’s gonna end up happening, you go out for a couple of beers and end up on a fishing boat to Nova Scotia!"
20008,Chandler,"Oh yeah, itÂ’s beautiful country up there."
20010,Chandler,ItÂ’s not gonna be exactly like last time.
20019,Chandler,"HeÂ’s not gonna make it, heÂ’s stuck in Chicago."
20021,Chandler,"Stupid, useless Canadian money!"
20100,Chandler,"Yeah, and I-I gave first names to all of the foosball players."
20103,Chandler,"Oh-no, yÂ’know with Gandolf weÂ’d be out all night!"
20114,Chandler,And may-maybe we could end up on a boat again?
20118,Chandler,"Remember that really cold morning, you woke up and those dogs were licking your face?"
20120,Chandler,"Well, those were seals, man."
20148,Chandler,"Yeah, all right."
20154,Chandler,"Actually, me too."
20161,Chandler,"Actually, can I get some hot water with a little lemon? I think I strained my voice screaming in there. Does it have to be so loud?"
20166,Chandler,"YÂ’know what? WeÂ’re not sad, weÂ’re not sad, weÂ’re just not 21 anymore. YÂ’know? IÂ’m 29 years old, damnit! And I want to sit in a comfortable chair, and watch television and go to bed at a reasonable hour!"
20218,Chandler,"Oh, yeah! How did you meet her?"
20222,Chandler,Were you so late because you were burring this woman?
20228,Chandler,"All right, who keeps leaving old newspapers in the trash?! I really wanted to take Kathy to this, I canÂ’t believe I missed it."
20230,Chandler,Really?! I didnÂ’t think girls ever just wanted a fling.
20233,Chandler,"YÂ’know what? ThereÂ’s some nice guys at my office, do you want me to set you up?"
20235,Chandler,"Well, I have a girlfriend, IÂ’m-IÂ’m happy. So, I no longer feel the need to go out of my way to stop others from being happy."
20237,Chandler,Oh and Ross was like what? A lion tamer?
20250,Chandler,"Hey, you know what you can do? I remember reading about this director, I think it was Orson Wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just so he could fire them in front of everybody. Then they would all know, whoÂ’s boss."
20259,Chandler,"See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up."
20261,Chandler,"Oh, yÂ’know what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling, that might be all right with Rachel."
20268,Chandler,"Oh well, thatÂ’s uh, a little later than I uh, generally care to stay, but sure!"
20270,Chandler,"Well, I donÂ’t really know what that is, but letÂ’s!!"
20289,Chandler,Wherever! IÂ’ve got like 20!
20291,Chandler,"YÂ’know what, IÂ’m gonna uh, play the field just a little more."
20293,Chandler,Guys are signing over their 401-KÂ’s to me?
20297,Chandler,"Yes, and his father invented that magnetic strip on the back of credit cards."
20299,Chandler,"See, IÂ’m not bad at this fixing up thing, huh?"
20301,Chandler,"Oh, he works in the Fine Foods division."
20303,Chandler,"ItÂ’s a big company, I donÂ’tÂ—if youÂ—I"
20312,Chandler,Oh yeah! With who?
20332,Chandler,"Well, like father, like son."
20334,Chandler,Really?! I-I thought you werenÂ’t looking for something serious? I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling.
20338,Chandler,Why not?! IÂ’d be thrilled if I heard that some hot girl was just looking to getÂ—oh I see.
20363,Chandler,"IÂ’m not Jewish, so"
20367,Chandler,"Oh yeah, then uh, what was PhoebeÂ’s song about?"
20377,Chandler,I did! I absolutely did!
20379,Chandler,"IÂ’m sure youÂ’re right, but why?"
20381,Chandler,"Oh, man. IÂ’m sorry, IÂ’m so-so sorry."
20383,Chandler,I know! I know!
20387,Chandler,"Yeah! You graduated Magma Ku Laude, right?"
20391,Chandler,"Well, actually itÂ’s a hockey team, so itÂ’s angry Canadians with no teeth."
20393,Chandler,Have you ever been with a woman?
20395,Chandler,So there is no good time to ask that question.
20448,Chandler,"I donÂ’t know, but Donald Trump wants his blue blazer black."
20450,Chandler,Blue blazer back. He-he wants it back.
20452,Chandler,"Well, you-you know what I meant."
20454,Chandler,So what job did you get Joe?
20474,Chandler,YouÂ’re gonna be carrying their baby and give them a Sony Play Station?
20489,Chandler,"Oh, yeah, sure, itÂ’s not mine anyway. It can with the pants."
20493,Chandler,Yes. Right where?
20495,Chandler,"Yeah, you-you gotta love the talking."
20497,Chandler,"All right, we havenÂ’t had sex yet. Okay, whatÂ’s the big deal? YÂ’know? This is special, and I want our love to grow until we move on to the next level."
20501,Chandler,"No, heÂ’s right, IÂ’m totally lying."
20503,Chandler,"Well, KathyÂ’s last boyfriend was Joey."
20505,Chandler,"No, IÂ’m afraid I wonÂ’t be able to make love as well as him."
20507,Chandler,"Yes, and I was saying the actual words."
20509,Chandler,"We share a wall! So either heÂ’s great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot."
20517,Chandler,"All right, all right, IÂ’ll go sleep with my girlfriend. But IÂ’m just doing it for you guys."
20566,Chandler,Why is Phoebe singing to Carl Mulden?
20571,Chandler,"Yes, yes, we had the sex."
20573,Chandler,"It was fine, yÂ’know? But she didnÂ’t agree with me as strongly as she agreed with Joey. She was more like, ""I see you point, IÂ’m all right with it."""
20576,Chandler,"Look, you have to help me! Okay? I mean, I know what to do with a woman, yÂ’know, I know where everything goes, itÂ’s always nice. But I need to know what makes it go from nice to, ""My God! SomebodyÂ’s killing her in there!"""
20578,Chandler,"Look, you donÂ’t have to draw an actual woÂ—whoa! SheÂ’s hot!"
20584,Chandler,"Oh, yÂ’know-yÂ’know what, I was looking at it upside down."
20589,Chandler,Well you might if it were anything like 7!
20663,Chandler,"Oh, I can uh, check that for ya."
20672,Chandler,I can check that for ya.
20674,Chandler,WellÂ… we-we do. You can only eat Tic Tacks in even numbers.
20682,Chandler,"Okay, ten bucks says that we can name every item in that bag."
20705,Chandler,"Well, we used thereÂ’s up last night making scary faces."
20707,Chandler,All right! Ten buck! Fork it over! Cough it up! Pay the piper! Gimme it.
20746,Chandler,Fears and Pet Peeves.
20755,Chandler,His legs flail about as if independent of his body!
20760,Chandler,She has a real name.
20762,Chandler,Althea?! What are you doing?!
20764,Chandler,You're shooting with Althea?!
20773,Chandler,"Actually, itÂ’s Miss Chinandolor Bong."
20783,Chandler,Unfortunately that is correct.
20789,Chandler,"I majored in lightning rounds. All right, weÂ’re gonna destroy you."
20791,Chandler,"Well, IÂ’m so confused as to what weÂ’ve been doing so far"
20812,Chandler,"But if we win, we get your apartment."
20865,Chandler,You canÂ’t just call MonicaÂ’s room.
20870,Chandler,"Oh, I would never bet this apartment. ItÂ’s too nice."
20877,Chandler,"Yeah, but I bet it works."
20883,Chandler,Well believe it baby!
20893,Chandler,I knew it!
20895,Chandler,"Cool, girl roommate."
20924,Chandler,Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving day for us!
20937,Chandler,What?! What-what is it?!
20939,Chandler,I canÂ’t believe we live here!
20941,Chandler,"Okay, she is the star of the play. And she is my girlfriend! I get to have sex with the star of the play!"
20944,Chandler,Wow! She looks great. DoesnÂ’t she?
20949,Chandler,"Is it just me, or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat?!"
20978,Chandler,"Yeah, itÂ’s like someone literally wrote down my worst nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it!"
20980,Chandler,"IÂ’m totally screwed. Okay, they are gonna be hot and heavy on stage every night, and then theyÂ’re gonna go to their cast parties and heÂ’s gonna try to undermine me. Y'know itÂ’ll be like, ""So whereÂ’s your boyfriend, whatÂ’s-his-name, Chester?"" And sheÂ’ll go, ""No-no-no, itÂ’s Chandler."" And heÂ’ll go, ""Whatever. Ha-ha-ha-ha!"""
20982,Chandler,"All right, look, look, what am I gonna do?"
20997,Chandler,"So uh, man, are you gonna go to the play with me tonight?"
20999,Chandler,"Yeah, I know but"
21007,Chandler,"Okay, okay, but donÂ’t worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles, and, jams, jellies, and marmalades. Which IÂ’m fairly certain are the same thing."
21032,Chandler,"IÂ’m right! Right? There was like no chemistry between them. Before they had heat, and now thereÂ’s no heat! Now you know what this means, Joey told us what this means!"
21034,Chandler,"Come on, it was like cousins having sex up there!"
21042,Chandler,"Oh, I loved the play. You were great, and Nick ditto. Clearly youÂ’re having sex with him."
21045,Chandler,"Oh come on, it was so obvious! There was no chemistry between you two!"
21047,Chandler,"YÂ’know, I-I could see how this could happen, y'know youÂ’re up there every night, youÂ’re naked, touching, kissing."
21049,Chandler,"Well, you can understand, given how we started."
21051,Chandler,"Well, that is what happened, and I donÂ’t even see you denying this!"
21053,Chandler,"Yeah, well, donÂ’t expect that to happen anytime soon!"
21096,Chandler,"Well, I may be drunk, but I know what she said! Then I went over to Beefsteak JulieÂ’s"
21127,Chandler,Did she call?
21129,Chandler,"All right, maybe I should call her."
21132,Chandler,"Well, yeah, but y'know, what-what if I was wrong?"
21134,Chandler,"Well y'know, what if she didnÂ’t actually sleep with the guy?"
21136,Chandler,"She did not have to tell me, I saw the play, and there was no heat. Back me up here, Ross!"
21138,Chandler,"ThatÂ’s not backing me up! Look, you said with the off-stage and the heat, and the onstage and the oy heat."
21140,Chandler,Oh my God!!
21166,Chandler,"Hey. I just, I just wanted to come over to-to say that IÂ’m sorry. YÂ’know? I know I acted like the biggest idiot in the world, and I can completely understand why you were so upset."
21170,Chandler,"Yeah. Well, I think our second fight is going to be a big one!"
21192,Chandler,"Well, she wasnÂ’t sleeping with him."
21194,Chandler,She is now.
21196,Chandler,"IÂ’m saying that sheÂ… is a devil woman! YÂ’know I mean you think you know someone and then they turn around and they sleep with Nick! Nick, with his rock hard pecs, and his giant man-nipples! I hate him, I hate her! Well, I donÂ’t hate her, I love her. This is all my fault really."
21198,Chandler,"Because, I-I shouldÂ’ve called! YÂ’know if I had just called her after our big, stupid fight, she never wouldÂ’ve gone out with Nick, and they wouldÂ’ve ended up in bed together. I threw her at his man nipples!"
21262,Chandler,"YÂ’know, I canÂ’t believe Kathy did this too me. I really, thought that she was the one. I tell you what, from now on IÂ’m never getting out of this chair, ever! Okay? From now on, this chair is the one! You wanna what else is the one? My sweat pants!"
21338,Chandler,ThatÂ’s right! Where are the guys? IÂ’m ready to get drunk and see some strippers.
21340,Chandler,They got a breakfast buffet.
21342,Chandler,"Ooh, let me talk to him!"
21344,Chandler,"Well, can I just"
21346,Chandler,SheÂ’s shhing me! ItÂ’s my phone and sheÂ’s shhing me!
21354,Chandler,"Maybe, she doesnÂ’t hit him all the time."
21365,Chandler,"So yÂ’know, uh, whenÂ’s he getting back?"
21369,Chandler,"Yes you can. YouÂ’re thinking about time, you canÂ’t go back in time."
21394,Chandler,"No thanks, Mom!"
21405,Chandler,"Ahh, come on! YÂ’know whatÂ—yÂ’know what, I think IÂ’m just gonna go home and call Kathy."
21407,Chandler,"No! That was a test! In a couple of hours IÂ’m gonna get really drunk and wanna call Kathy and you guys are gonna have to stop me! And then after that, IÂ’m gonna get so drunk, IÂ’m gonna wanna call Janice"
21430,Chandler,"Oh yeah, that was great. Thanks to you, the hottest cocktail waitress there is quitting to teach the third grade!"
21436,Chandler,"All right, well IÂ’m gonna put my sweats back on."
21444,Chandler,"Okay, look, IÂ’m gonna have to ask you all to leave."
21457,Chandler,I am totally picturing you with all those women!
21459,Chandler,"Well, IÂ’m there too!"
21461,Chandler,Stop it! YouÂ’re killing me! I think I just moved on to Phase Four!
21463,Chandler,Where I donÂ’t want to have a relationship ever! I just want to have sex with strippers and my friends!!
21464,Chandler,"Come on, let me see that smile."
21468,Chandler,"I know, I know, but youÂ’re gonna have plenty of chances. There are literally thousands of women out there just waiting to screw me over."
21491,Chandler,"Oh, thatÂ’s fine! Go with your instincts, go with your instincts."
21493,Chandler,"Come on! Would you please pay attention, I could wake up at any moment!"
21502,Chandler,"Hey, you know who used to have nails like that?"
21518,Chandler,IsnÂ’t this amazing?
21535,Chandler,"Yeah, I know, but all of those little annoying things she did before we fell in love? Like her voice, her laugh, her personalityÂ—Well, theyÂ’re all back! YÂ’know? And sheÂ’s picked up like nine new ones!"
21564,Chandler,"Yes, I-I know that you do, but I think one of the reasons people were complaining though, was that they paid to hear the actor sing Old Man River."
21568,Chandler,Right! I just think that this is happening too soon.
21572,Chandler,"No! No! Not, Paris."
21576,Chandler,I donÂ’t know exactly.
21578,Chandler,But I do know that itÂ’s some time tomorrow.
21595,Chandler,"YÂ’know uh, you didnÂ’t really have to help me pack."
21597,Chandler,"Well, I-I thought I did but, I-I guess I did not!"
21599,Chandler,"Oh, IÂ’m packing. YÂ’know IÂ’m-IÂ’m packing Â‘cause IÂ’m moving to Yemen tomorrow."
21601,Chandler,"IÂ’m only going to pretend IÂ’m moving to Yemen, itÂ’s the only way I can get rid off her."
21652,Chandler,"YÂ’know you, really didnÂ’t have to take me to the airport."
21658,Chandler,"Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just, I just need a pretend ticket."
21660,Chandler,What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?
21730,Chandler,"Well, I-I guess I gotta go."
21732,Chandler,"Well, just until we find an energy source to replace fuel."
21734,Chandler,"Okay, good-bye. Good-bye."
21738,Chandler,"Janice! There you are! There you are! I had to have one last kiss, and also-also you said that you were going to leave right after I got on the plane!"
21750,Chandler,Wow! Pregnancy does give you some weird cravings.
21758,Chandler,What are you writing?
21778,Chandler,"Yes, but in RossÂ’s case, they both know in two weeks thatÂ’s it."
21783,Chandler,Maybe thatÂ’s because soy-burgers suck!
21808,Chandler,What are you talking about?
21823,Chandler,"I said, ""Like what?"""
21849,Chandler,Does for me.
21856,Chandler,She was a welder.
21874,Chandler,What are the odds? What are the odds?
22003,Chandler,TreegerÂ’s snaking the shower drain.
22008,Chandler,Do we pay for this?
22010,Chandler,Maybe we shouldnÂ’t pay our phone billÂ—free phone sex.
22013,Chandler,"Yeah, Joey just pressed something on the remote and it just, came on!"
22015,Chandler,Like finding money with naked people on it!
22019,Chandler,We donÂ’t know what could make this go away.
22021,Chandler,And no one touches the air around the TV!
22024,Chandler,We still have porn.
22033,Chandler,Or a job where you donÂ’t have to carry a table.
22111,Chandler,ItÂ’s the theme from Good Will Humping.
22115,Chandler,"Oh-oh, yeah, and did he also say that ah, some of the dialogue was corny and that he actually found it was funny and not sexy?"
22124,Chandler,They donÂ’t really talk to us about that kind of stuff. I can get you some free white out though.
22131,Chandler,"Whoa-whoa, wait a minute, did you say, you love her?"
22137,Chandler,"All right look, forget it, forget it. You told her you love her, itÂ’s over."
22146,Chandler,"Hi! Listen, can we watch cartoons on your television? We need a porn break. We spent the last two hours watching In & Out & In, Again."
22148,Chandler,Because then we would be the guys who turned off free porn.
22154,Chandler,Pregnant Woman Slays Four?
22161,Chandler,WhatÂ’s the second part of your plan?
22175,Chandler,You put your fist through the wall?
22200,Chandler,A place where no one will ever get out alive?
22217,Chandler,Are we in London?
22235,Chandler,"I was just at the bank, and there was this really hot teller, and she didnÂ’t ask me to go do it with her in the vault."
22237,Chandler,"What, no, ""Nice apartment, I bet the bedrooms are huge?"""
22239,Chandler,"YÂ’know what, we have to turn off the porn."
22241,Chandler,"All right, ready?"
22245,Chandler,"Yeah, thatÂ’s kinda a relief."
22247,Chandler,You wanna see if we still have it?
22251,Chandler,We have free porn here!!!
22254,Chandler,"Hey! Wow, it is true what they say, pregnant bellies look like a drum."
22265,Chandler,WouldnÂ’t that be Frank the III?
22293,Chandler,Hey! Do we have a baby name yet?
22295,Chandler,"Well, it certainly worked for that Valdez kid."
22301,Chandler,"Well, Chandler will be there for you too. I mean, well, he might be a little late, but-but, heÂ’ll be there. And heÂ’ll bring you some cold soda, if want you need him for is that youÂ’re really hot."
22318,Chandler,And now youÂ’re giving me the message!
22322,Chandler,You actually think that something can happen between Emily and Susan?
22325,Chandler,Hi! Hi! YouÂ’re crazy! Okay? This is Emily. Emily is straight.
22337,Chandler,"Okay, there are no famous JoeyÂ’s. Except for, huh, Joey Buttafucco."
22340,Chandler,"Okay, look, Joey! Come on, think about it, first of all, heÂ’ll never be President. ThereÂ’s never gonna be a President Joey."
22342,Chandler,"Wow, youÂ’re, youÂ’re right. I have a horrible, horrible name."
22430,Chandler,"No, no, youÂ’re right, it is a ridiculous name!"
22432,Chandler,"Yes it is! From now on, I have no first name."
22434,Chandler,I have no name.
22436,Chandler,"Okay uh, for now, temporarily, you can call me, Clint."
22438,Chandler,"Okay, so what name am I cool enough to pull off?"
22443,Chandler,ItÂ’s Clint! Clint!
22476,Chandler,"All right look, am I serious, okay? Tomorrow at 3:30 I am going down to the courthouse."
22478,Chandler,"Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life. Okay, itÂ’s probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well with womenÂ… So, as of 4 oÂ’clock tomorrow, IÂ’m either gonna be Mark Johnson or John Markson."
22484,Chandler,You wanna hug it out?
22493,Chandler,Ha! Ha! Ha!
22538,Chandler,Ho! Ho! Ho!
22551,Chandler,"Uhh, a T-shirt that says, ""I donÂ’t belong here."""
22558,Chandler,Yeah we do!
22562,Chandler,Are you serious?
22567,Chandler,"Forget it! Okay, IÂ’m not giving up my bachelor pad for some basketball seats!"
22570,Chandler,"No. But uh, Joey has, and I usually talk to them in the morning time."
22576,Chandler,"Forget it! Okay, IÂ’m not giving up the apartment."
22580,Chandler,Oh my God!
22583,Chandler,You do know that Wham broke up?
22586,Chandler,Where is Emily?
22588,Chandler,"Man, didnÂ’t she like just get here?"
22592,Chandler,So what are you going to do?
22596,Chandler,Are you serious?
22598,Chandler,"Because youÂ’ve only known her for six weeks! Okay, IÂ’ve got a carton of milk in my fridge IÂ’ve had a longer relationship with!"
22605,Chandler,"Okay, no problem, just remember to wake us up before you go-go."
22609,Chandler,No thank you.
22611,Chandler,"Look, I want those basketball seats as much as you do! Okay, but we canÂ’t leave in the small apartment after weÂ’ve lived here! DidnÂ’t you ever read Flowers for Algernon?"
22613,Chandler,"Look, the only way I will even consider this is if they offer a lot more than just season seats."
22615,Chandler,Screw the Knicks!
22617,Chandler,I didnÂ’t mean that. I just meant that the apartment is worth so much more.
22619,Chandler,And the Knicks rule all.
22622,Chandler,"No. No. WeÂ’re not gonna do that, yÂ’know why? Because its not an even trade."
22634,Chandler,"Op, op, IÂ’m convinced!"
22636,Chandler,"All right, but you canÂ’t use that again for a whole year. IÂ’m in."
22654,Chandler,"Fine, letÂ’s do it."
22659,Chandler,"Okay, you guys uh, you guys pick first"
22662,Chandler,ThatÂ’s a low one!
22666,Chandler,Why are you screaming and hugging?
22681,Chandler,No they didnÂ’t!
22716,Chandler,Those were like the best seats ever.
22718,Chandler,"Oh yeah, thatÂ’s very nice. Plus, yÂ’know they were free and theyÂ’re too small."
22722,Chandler,Open up! Open up! Open up!
22724,Chandler,What the hell is going on?!
22727,Chandler,"We are switching back, right now!"
22729,Chandler,"Well, youÂ’re gonna have to leave sometime, because you both have jobs, and as soon as you do, weÂ’re switching it back! ThereÂ’s nothing you can do to stop us! Right, Joe?"
22733,Chandler,"I donÂ’t care, this is our apartment! And they stoleÂ—you stole itÂ—our apartment, and we won that apartment fair and square, twice! And I am getting it back right now. IÂ’m getting back right now!"
22735,Chandler,"Oh no-no-no, no more offers. You canÂ’t offer anything to us!"
22738,Chandler,Totally worth it!
22762,Chandler,"Oh, well, thatÂ’s great!"
22774,Chandler,Are you kidding me?! Joey. Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey!!
22776,Chandler,"Oh. Oh, did-did-did I wake you?"
22781,Chandler,"Well, I am drinking lots of cups of coffee because IÂ’m exhausted! Because Joey started snoring!"
22784,Chandler,"ItÂ’s not something to be proud of, okay? You have to go to a sleep clinic!"
22786,Chandler,They donÂ’t have those.
22791,Chandler,"Next time you snore, IÂ’m rolling ya over!"
22794,Chandler,"Hey, all right!"
22810,Chandler,"YÂ’know, whipped! Wah-pah!"
22812,Chandler,ThatÂ’s what I did. Wah-pah!
22879,Chandler,"Hey, I hear that you and Joshua are going out to dinner with Ross and Emily, and I think thatÂ’s, I think thatÂ’s really cool."
22884,Chandler,"Yeah, well, I donÂ’t dance at weddings."
22934,Chandler,You mind if I
22936,Chandler,"So uh, what are you in for?"
22938,Chandler,"What a coincidence, I listen in my sleep."
22976,Chandler,Because IÂ’m cooler.
22978,Chandler,"Well sheÂ’s, sheÂ’s the kinda girlÂ—Joey was unconscious."
22985,Chandler,"Plus, you look cool."
23031,Chandler,YÂ’know what? It seems like all of the sudden; so much has happened.
23033,Chandler,"Phoebe is, making people."
23035,Chandler,"And we just sit here. I mean if I die the only way people would even know I was here, would be by the ass print on this chair! Look, we have to do something. Okay? Something huge!"
23037,Chandler,"No-no, not something stupid, something huge."
23039,Chandler,"Why not?! I mean itÂ’s just, itÂ’s just climbing! ItÂ’s just, itÂ’s just steep!"
23041,Chandler,"WeÂ’re going to Everest! Okay, it would be nice to leave an ass print on Everest!"
23050,Chandler,"Yeah, we could do that without yÂ’know risking our lives at all!"
23056,Chandler,But IÂ’ll tell you something. One of these days weÂ’re get off of our buts and rent Die Hard again!
23148,Chandler,She was not good. Not good.
23175,Chandler,I didnÂ’t know that.
23182,Chandler,"See, maybe thatÂ’s the one we shouldÂ’ve actually hidden."
23188,Chandler,"This isnÂ’t one of those uh, yÂ’know ""If she doesnÂ’t come, we-we donÂ’t, we donÂ’t come?"" Right? Because I already bought my ticket"
23192,Chandler,"Oh, that's Ross's."
23198,Chandler,"Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?"
23241,Chandler,I KNEW IT!!!!
23251,Chandler,"Ahh, so how many cameras are actually on you?"
23276,Chandler,"Well, You could, but... probably just the one time."
23278,Chandler,"If we do that, we gotta get Die Hard."
23295,Chandler,"Oh, itÂ’s awkward. ItÂ’s awkward. ItÂ’s awkward."
23300,Chandler,You can be the best man when I get married.
23303,Chandler,"Oh no-no-no, youÂ—yeah, of course you get to be my best man."
23305,Chandler,"IÂ’m not even getting married! Okay, this is a question for science fiction writers!"
23308,Chandler,IÂ’m not evenÂ… IÂ’m not even
23350,Chandler,"Yeah, well, good luck trying to top the last one."
23352,Chandler,"Oh, IÂ’m Ross. IÂ’m Ross. IÂ’m too good for the Hut; IÂ’m too good for the Hut."
23358,Chandler,"He just said, ""No strippers."""
23404,Chandler,"Ugh. Just a sec, give me a minute to wake up for thisÂ—Ah-ha-ha!! You lost the ring! YouÂ’re the worst best man ever!"
23406,Chandler,You slept with the stripper?
23437,Chandler,"So you might say, itÂ’s a magic ring."
23440,Chandler,"Well, I think it all started when you said, ""Hey Joey, why donÂ’t you be my best man."""
23449,Chandler,"Well, what if we just ah, called her, used a fake name, and had her come to my office?"
23475,Chandler,"Way to be cool, man."
23511,Chandler,"He will, Joe."
23521,Chandler,"Hey, come on, itÂ’s not your fault."
23523,Chandler,"No, you should."
23531,Chandler,What a baby.
23535,Chandler,Six-hour trip to London. ThatÂ’s a lot of Monica.
23546,Chandler,You got your passport?
23549,Chandler,There it is.
23557,Chandler,"Okay, Â‘cause thatÂ’s not gonna get annoying."
23559,Chandler,"Hey, yÂ’know what? I was wrong."
23592,Chandler,"I am, IÂ’m ignoring you."
23594,Chandler,"Oh, what the hell is that?"
23596,Chandler,"Okay, if you see a little version of me in there? Kill it!"
23598,Chandler,"Okay. Listen-listen, weÂ’re not gonna have to walk this way the entire time are we?"
23621,Chandler,"I think itÂ’s great. ItÂ’s great. YÂ’know, theyÂ’re thinking of changing the name of this place."
23623,Chandler,To Put the Camera Away!!!
23651,Chandler,"Well, I donÂ’t have to buy that, ""IÂ’m with stupid"" T-shirt anymore."
23653,Chandler,"All right, look, youÂ’re not really gonna buy that are you? DonÂ’t you think youÂ’ve embarrassed me enough for one day?"
23655,Chandler,How can I answer that when IÂ’m pretending I donÂ’t know you?
23657,Chandler,Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them?
23659,Chandler,"All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, yÂ’know, youÂ’re gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself."
23711,Chandler,"No-no-no, yÂ’know what? I really shouldnÂ’t have said that you were embarrassing me, I mean that really wasnÂ’t cool. And if it makes you feel any better, IÂ’ve had a really lousy day."
23721,Chandler,ThatÂ’sÂ… ThatÂ’s was
23725,Chandler,How did you? How? How?
23732,Chandler,IÂ’m gonna go to the bathroom.
23749,Chandler,That was pretty intense huh?
23797,Chandler,"Joey, itÂ’s been three days, okay.. Your just a little homesick, Okay. Would you just try to relax. Just, just try to enjoy yourself."
23820,Chandler,"It couldÂ’ve been worse, he couldÂ’ve shot her."
23838,Chandler,"Oh wow, I hope you donÂ’t take this the wrong way but, I know we had plans to meet up tonight and, ugh, IÂ’m just kinda worried about what it might do to our friendship."
23842,Chandler,"In a foreign, romantic country"
23846,Chandler,"Well, I donÂ’t see that we have a choice. But, when weÂ’re back home, we donÂ’t do it."
23848,Chandler,"YÂ’know, I saw a wine cellar downstairs"
23867,Chandler,"Forget it, thatÂ’s off."
23873,Chandler,The manÂ’s got a point.
23892,Chandler,"Listen, in the middle of everything if I scream the word, ""Yippee!"" just ignore me."
23894,Chandler,"Oh, hello Rachel."
23896,Chandler,"Yes, we do. But, we have to change first."
23898,Chandler,"Yeah, weÂ’ll be down in like five minutes."
23911,Chandler,"Wow, you look"
23914,Chandler,"Well, IÂ’ve got a girl in here."
23916,Chandler,"Well, weÂ’re-weÂ’re hanging out in here!"
23918,Chandler,"Well, I suppose IÂ’d have to say you!! But, what if weÂ’re watching a movie in here?"
23922,Chandler,"Well, Ross and Emily arenÂ’t gonna use it."
23924,Chandler,"Oh Mon-Mon-Mon-Mon-look, this is the honeymoon suite. The room expects sex. The room would be disappointed if it didnÂ’t get sex. All of the other honeymoon suites would think it was a loser."
23928,Chandler,"Nope, not under here!"
23931,Chandler,"Well, you couldnÂ’t have looked everywhere or else you wouldÂ’ve found her!"
23933,Chandler,"Yeah, for about 30 minutes."
23938,Chandler,"Yeah, weÂ’re gonna go."
23941,Chandler,"Yeah, itÂ’s a very large plane."
23943,Chandler,"But, weÂ’ll stay here with you."
23945,Chandler,We have to leave for New York in an hour.
23947,Chandler,"We canÂ’t do that thatÂ’s insane. I mean Â‘AÂ’ he could wake up and Â‘BÂ’ yÂ’know, letÂ’s go for it."
23984,Chandler,No we didnÂ’t!
23993,Chandler,"Yes! Good thing we have that, Â‘Not in New YorkÂ’ rule."
23997,Chandler,"Oh. YÂ’know, that night meant a lot to me too, and it wasnÂ’t because I was in a bad place or anything, it just meant a lot to me Â‘cause, youÂ’re really hot! Is that okay?"
23999,Chandler,And IÂ’m cute too.
24060,Chandler,"Ehh, you're just liquored up."
24062,Chandler,"I've had a very long, hard day."
24064,Chandler,"Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then."
24067,Chandler,"For the last time no! Get out! Get out, Joey!"
24069,Chandler,"Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me about chicken."
24072,Chandler,"Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a Coke-(Yelps in"
24083,Chandler,"Uh, The Wheatsheaf."
24087,Chandler,"Ooh! Ahh, Pheebs, was gonna tell a story."
24105,Chandler,I can't believe she can out run you man!
24118,Chandler,"Oh, Ross, when you make out card; be sure to make it out to, EM-I-LY."
24121,Chandler,Oh that's not true.
24128,Chandler,"Okay, I gotta go to work."
24129,Chandler,"And uh, Rachel, glad to have you back."
24153,Chandler,"All right, y'know what, we've been talking about London too much haven't we?"
24162,Chandler,"I got caught up and work, but I'm quitting tomorrow."
24234,Chandler,I was just trying to bring a little culture to the group.
24242,Chandler,"Okay, Pheebs, we decided the picnic idea was a littleÂ… Y'know, it didn't have anyÂ… It-it, well it blew. So, we thought, that this afternoon that we would all go away for the whole weekend to, Atlantic City!"
24293,Chandler,Pheebs! We have to take you to the hospital now!
24298,Chandler,"I know, it's beautiful. Amazing."
24299,Chandler,"Y'know what else I can't believe? I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel every time I left a room, I mean it's too bad they didn't see us having sex."
24340,Chandler,Hey! You okay?
24346,Chandler,"Did he just say, he loves Fonzie?"
24354,Chandler,"Yeah, that's when if you get the babies out by the end of the month, they give you 2% financing."
24374,Chandler,Really? Male nurses?
24376,Chandler,So they're going on dates? When?
24383,Chandler,"This-this Fonzie person you keep referring too, is that uh, is that another doctor?"
24393,Chandler,"Oh, is this about you-you dating the nurse? Yeah, Joey already told me, and I am so-so fine. I mean, you and I we're just, y'know, we're nothing, we're goofin' around."
24395,Chandler,Fine! Maybe I will too!
24459,Chandler,"So Dan, nurse not a doctor huh? Kinda girlie isn't it?"
24470,Chandler,All right. Very good.
24516,Chandler,"Oh God, kindergarten flashback."
24518,Chandler,"Okay, keep saying it!"
24530,Chandler,"So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?"
24532,Chandler,"Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionaryÂ… Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. I am so bad at this."
24534,Chandler,"Really? Okay, so"
24536,Chandler,"Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?"
24552,Chandler,"So uh, now that little Chandler turned out to be a girl, what are they gonna name her?"
24554,Chandler,"That's kind of a masculine name, don't you think?"
24575,Chandler,"Oh no-no-no-no-no-no, vomit tux! No-no, vomit tux!"
24586,Chandler,Well y'know a lot of those Muppets don't have thumbs.
24616,Chandler,"Uhh, yeah. She uh, she uh, she uh might've mentioned him."
24619,Chandler,"Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet."
24650,Chandler,"If you're cooking on the stove, does that mean that your new secret boyfriend is better in bed than Richard?"
24682,Chandler,"Well, you can't just not see Rachel anymore, she's one of your best friends."
24696,Chandler,"Hey, there he is! There he is!"
24699,Chandler,"How many times have I told you guys, you never watch the cooking channel!"
24703,Chandler,"Oh that was yours? Uh, yeah, we used it when the duck was throwing up caterpillars."
24707,Chandler,"Well I just, thought maybe you'd wanna book some time with the best you'd ever had."
24711,Chandler,What's your point?
24744,Chandler,"I mean I was nothing before you. Call the other girls and ask. Which wouldn't take long. But when I'm with you, and we're together, OHÂ…MYÂ…GOD."
24746,Chandler,"Oh-aw my God! Now, I understand if you never want to sleep with me again, but that would be wrong. We're too good! We owe it, to sex!"
24750,Chandler,"Yeah, why don't we lose the gloves."
24752,Chandler,"All right, let's show them how it's done."
24755,Chandler,Y'know that wasn't part of it?
24781,Chandler,"I know, me too. Hey! Y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend? Y'know we'd have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time."
24783,Chandler,"Yeah, I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing."
24790,Chandler,I'm not in charge of where the conference is held. Do you want people to think it's a fake conference? It's a real conference.
24797,Chandler,What's going on?
24808,Chandler,We're flipping Monica's mattress.
24817,Chandler,"Oh yes, somebody just said, ""Can you hear anything?"""
24824,Chandler,And condoms are the way to do that?
24836,Chandler,"Oh, you should live with Joey, Roll-os everywhere."
24838,Chandler,"Oh yes! Monica, get in here! There's a high-speed car chase on!"
24856,Chandler,Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!
24870,Chandler,"Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun?"
24872,Chandler,"Oh, who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms?"
24874,Chandler,Do not speak ill of the dead.
24876,Chandler,"I just want to watch a little television. What is the big deal? Geez, relax mom."
24878,Chandler,"I said, ""Geez, relax Monnnnn."""
24902,Chandler,"Uh, no, I got to see Donald Trump waiting for an elevator."
24908,Chandler,"Well, maybe it was the kind of food that tasted good at first but then made everybody vomit and have diarrhea."
24912,Chandler,"Okay, fine, $300."
24914,Chandler,"Yeah, just think of it as $25 per room!"
24939,Chandler,"Okay, Ross is in the bathroom."
24944,Chandler,"Kip, my old roommate, y'know we all used to hang out together."
24953,Chandler,Yes that was mine.
24955,Chandler,Yes that would have made more sense.
24978,Chandler,"I just came over to drop offÂ…nothing. So that weekend kinda sucked, huh?"
24980,Chandler,"So, I guess this is over."
24982,Chandler,"Well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime."
24984,Chandler,"Because of the weekend, we had a fight."
24986,Chandler,"So, this isn't over?"
24988,Chandler,Really? Okay. Great!
25007,Chandler,It happened in London.
25009,Chandler,The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.
25011,Chandler,No-no-no-no-no! You can't!
25030,Chandler,Aren't you supposed to be at an audition for another hour?
25059,Chandler,"Okay, but don't you think this is a little extreme?"
25066,Chandler,"Yeah I know, we're losing Ross, Joey said hence"
25080,Chandler,You're on in 5 Ms. Minnelli.
25087,Chandler,So you're really okay with this?
25089,Chandler,"Now that's so funny, because last Christmas I got the gift of space. We should get them together and make a continuum."
25129,Chandler,"Okay, what is in here? Rocks?"
25145,Chandler,"Look, we just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable."
25152,Chandler,Kind of? If you just kept this to yourself none of this would've happened.
25154,Chandler,"Well, I think it's very brave what you said."
25156,Chandler,"Pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? How about the whole animal rights thing?"
25186,Chandler,"Yeah, we are so sorry."
25229,Chandler,"Oh yeah, there-there she is!"
25255,Chandler,Are you looking at naked tribe's women?
25257,Chandler,That's a pig.
25264,Chandler,How can he do that? Didn't you sign a lease?
25267,Chandler,"Oh, yeah! Absolutely! Anything you need man! But you have to promise me the second you are feeling better so that we can make fun of your hair!"
25273,Chandler,He thought you said gonad.
25326,Chandler,Love what you've done with the place.
25334,Chandler,"Oh, the tears are real."
25347,Chandler,What are you doing?
25349,Chandler,You built a fort didn't ya?
25353,Chandler,I hate this thing!
25381,Chandler,Bye-bye little puppet Joey hand?
25391,Chandler,"Okay, so he's out of here."
25410,Chandler,"Well, I-I-I'm done with this. You want anything Ross? Sports? International? Apartment listings?"
25416,Chandler,Not even on page 7?
25418,Chandler,What about that circled one?
25421,Chandler,"Yes, it is."
25425,Chandler,There we go!
25427,Chandler,Let's go quicker.
25430,Chandler,"Yeah, well look at this kitchen, slash bathroom. Well that's great! Y'know so you can cook while in the tub."
25434,Chandler,"Yeah, you don't want to be stuck with us for the next five weeks."
25439,Chandler,It's a kitchen slash bathroom.
25441,Chandler,We are bad people.
25458,Chandler,Yes that was a nice place!
25460,Chandler,"Not a lot of closet space, but he can just hang his stuff out the window in a bag!"
25462,Chandler,What are we gonna do?
25499,Chandler,"98. 99. 100. Okay, go!"
25501,Chandler,Here we go! Here we go!
25506,Chandler,"You're kidding, no!"
25514,Chandler,"Yes! Ross, you have to stay!"
25517,Chandler,"All right, buddy!"
25519,Chandler,"Well, I see you've had a very productive day. Don't you think the cowboy hat is a little much?"
25534,Chandler,"That's sweet, Joey."
25537,Chandler,Are you aware that you're still talking?
25542,Chandler,No-no-no! I am the king of bad Thanksgivings. You can't just swoop in here with your bad marriage and take that away from me.
25546,Chandler,"It's a tradition, like the parade. If the parade decided it was gay, moved out, and abandoned its entire family."
25553,Chandler,"Really? Worse than, ""More turkey Mr. Chandler?"""
25567,Chandler,It's exactly like it sounds.
25596,Chandler,I'm over here big guy.
25606,Chandler,"Oh, come on Monica, reliving past pain and getting depressed is what Thanksgiving is all about. Y'know, for me anyway. And of course, the Indians."
25630,Chandler,"Well, as long as the pilgrims didn't eat it, I'm in."
25642,Chandler,"Oh yeah, it was great. You should be a chef."
25654,Chandler,"Right on! Oh! Uh, but, donÂ’t take to long okay? 'Cause uh, we're gonna test out our fake ID's tonight, right Clifford Alverez."
25656,Chandler,"Dude, don't do that too me!"
25658,Chandler,"No, it's not that, I just don't want to be stuck here all night with your fat sister."
25663,Chandler,I called you fat?! I don't even remember that!
25665,Chandler,I am so sorry. I really am. I was an idiot back then. I rushed the stage at a Wham concert for crying out loud!
25668,Chandler,"I am really sorry. That is so terrible. I am so, so sorry."
25674,Chandler,We wanna hear Monica's Thanksgiving story!
25693,Chandler,Oh my God!
25695,Chandler,"You just, you look so different! Terrific! That dress! That body!"
25722,Chandler,"Monica, I was wondering if you can make me some of that righteous mac and cheese like last year."
25726,Chandler,Are you all right?
25744,Chandler,Without my toe?! I need my toe!
25748,Chandler,That's why I lost my toe?! Because I called you fat?!
25750,Chandler,That's why for an entire year people called me Sir Limps-A-Lot?!
25756,Chandler,I can't believe this.
25758,Chandler,"Yeah, well, sorry doesnÂ’t bring back the little piggy that cried all the way home! I hate this stupid day! And everything about it! I'll see you later."
25761,Chandler,"Oh-oh, I'm a duck! I go, ""Quack, quack!"" IÂ’m happy all the time!"
25766,Chandler,This is not going to work.
25768,Chandler,You are so great! I love you!
25770,Chandler,"Nothing! I said, I said ""You're so great"" and then I just, I just stopped talking!"
25772,Chandler,No I didn't!
25774,Chandler,No I didn't!
25776,Chandler,No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
25783,Chandler,"Well, they're Joey's! They gotta be Joey's!"
25785,Chandler,See? They're Joey's! J-J-J-J-J-Joey's!
25800,Chandler,"Well, yeah actually."
25802,Chandler,"I know it sounds really weird, but we're just so bad at relationships."
25814,Chandler,I didn't know you were taking a class. That is so cool.
25825,Chandler,"Well, what did the police say?"
25827,Chandler,"Ross, it's just a sandwich!"
25835,Chandler,"Say Ross, when you picture Phoebe living on the street, is she surrounded by the entire cast of Annie?"
25880,Chandler,What is going on here?
25889,Chandler,OhÂ—I don't know.
25947,Chandler,"Which I may say, right now, is out of control."
25952,Chandler,And you're okay with that?
25975,Chandler,"All right, look! Look. I think I can explain this."
25977,Chandler,Joey's a sex addict.
25987,Chandler,Well let'sÂ….let's see what everybody thinks of that?
25999,Chandler,Are you sure Joe? Are you sure you're not just a sex addict?
26061,Chandler,"Yes! Chandler Bing, 7! Chandler Bing, 0."
26063,Chandler,"Okay, I'll stop."
26066,Chandler,You wanna play?
26068,Chandler,"Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home."
26072,Chandler,"Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit back."
26074,Chandler,Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?
26136,Chandler,"Well, why can't you do them tomorrow?"
26142,Chandler,"The only reason you're doing this to Joey is because you're bored. Okay, it's not his fault that you're unemployed."
26146,Chandler,"Oh, so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk?"
26150,Chandler,I paid for those tickets!
26155,Chandler,When did that happen to you?!
26157,Chandler,"Oh yeah. First off all, chasing the Churo guy isn't jogging."
26168,Chandler,I don't believe they're brother and sister.
26193,Chandler,"Oh hey! There's some kids playing in the street, you wanna go down there and give them a project, ruin their day?"
26200,Chandler,Yeah or also when you don't have somebody breathing down your neck ALL THE LIVE LONG DAY!!
26206,Chandler,What is up?
26208,Chandler,"No, it was me. I'm sorry. I over reacted."
26215,Chandler,"I am sorry, Ross."
26217,Chandler,This took you all day?!
26231,Chandler,"We wanted to kiss at midnight, but nobody else is going to so y'know"
26266,Chandler,"Do you want us to leave the room, or?"
26269,Chandler,"That's good one too, Pheebs. Now all you have to do is find a planeload of people who's resolution is to plummet to their deaths."
26308,Chandler,"What an interesting approach to guitar instruction. Y'know some might find it amusing, I myself find it regular."
26417,Chandler,Oh my God!
26485,Chandler,Did they teach you that in your anger management class?
26491,Chandler,"Oh, we had a lot of liquor left over from the Christmas party."
26507,Chandler,"Oh, that was my work laugh."
26509,Chandler,"Oh, believe me, to survive this party, you're gonna have to come up with one too."
26513,Chandler,Hey! Everybody at work loved you last night!
26557,Chandler,"Okay, easy Martina. I think we should let them win the next game."
26559,Chandler,Let them win one.
26561,Chandler,You're not even giving them a chance!
26566,Chandler,"Oopsey, missed it!"
26574,Chandler,It was my racquet.
26576,Chandler,If we hadn't lost the game they never would've invented us to dinner tomorrow night.
26578,Chandler,"Okay y'know what, because you said that, I'm not putting out tonight."
26644,Chandler,Just a little bit of sugar.
26647,Chandler,"Oh, you get used to it."
26649,Chandler,"So I laugh at my boss's jokes, what's the big deal?"
26655,Chandler,"Well, I-I just didn't think it was funny sir."
26657,Chandler,"Well, I just"
26670,Chandler,But we're not ready to tell yet!
26686,Chandler,"Man, she is really gullible."
26711,Chandler,Why would I be mad?
26715,Chandler,I also want you to remember that I let you live here rent free!
26720,Chandler,"Oh! Look at that, time's up! My turn!"
26722,Chandler,It's your timer.
26724,Chandler,"All right, then massage me up right nice!"
26725,Chandler,Ah! Ahh!! Ahh!!
26727,Chandler,It's so good I don't know what I've done to deserve it!
26730,Chandler,"I'm telling you, she gives the worst massages ever!! Okay, it was like she was torturing me for information. And I wanted to give it up I justÂ—I didn't know what it was!"
26732,Chandler,"Look, for the first time in my life I'm in a real relationship. Okay, I'm not gonna screw that up by y'know, telling the truth."
26739,Chandler,And you're gonna make them all disappear.
26794,Chandler,Wow! You look just like your son Mrs. Tribbiani!
26815,Chandler,Pulling flowers out it makes the bag look a lot more masculine.
26830,Chandler,Oh my God!
26845,Chandler,And a date with a man!
26863,Chandler,"I'm sorry but, ow-owww-owww!"
26883,Chandler,"Hey, is Rachel here?"
26889,Chandler,"Okay, but now see you're crying!"
26893,Chandler,"It's okay, you don't have to be the best at everything."
26895,Chandler,"Okay, you give the worst massages in the world."
26897,Chandler,"Okay, hear me out. Okay? You give the best bad massages. If anybody was looking for the best bad massage and they were thinking to themselves, ""Who's the best of that?"" They'd have to go to you."
26899,Chandler,"Oh, it would be you! You! Monica! And you'd get all the votes!"
26952,Chandler,"Hey man, how did the audition go?"
26958,Chandler,Oh my God!
26968,Chandler,"Yeah umm, they're called wallets."
26973,Chandler,And we're done with the chicken fried rice.
26978,Chandler,Or we can do the actual telephone thing.
27038,Chandler,"Phoebe, it's me. You can tell me anything."
27040,Chandler,What's going on?
27043,Chandler,"Well, my Grandfather was Swedish and my Grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny."
27045,Chandler,Y'know that is a popular opinion today I must say.
27047,Chandler,"The weirdest thing happened at the coffee house, I think, I think Phoebe was hitting on me."
27049,Chandler,I'm telling you I think Phoebe thinks I'm foxy.
27053,Chandler,"Oh, y'know I-I can't hear that enough."
27055,Chandler,"No, I didn't misunderstand, okay? She was all over me! She touched my bicep for crying out loud!"
27057,Chandler,Well it's not flexed right now!
27062,Chandler,"Sure, I'll do it with ya."
27075,Chandler,That new mountain bike?
27083,Chandler,Your work makes me sad.
27091,Chandler,"Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?"
27093,Chandler,Are you serious?
27098,Chandler,Phoebe knows about us!
27109,Chandler,"Ahh yes, the messers become the messies!"
27132,Chandler,"Well you know that thing you said before, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't intrigued."
27134,Chandler,"Yeah, listen, Joey isn't gonna be here tonight so why don't you come over and I'll let you uh, feel my bicep. Or maybe more."
27147,Chandler,"Oh yeah, they're totally gonna back down!"
27165,Chandler,"Okay, listen, how far am I gonna have to go with her?"
27167,Chandler,How do you know?!
27179,Chandler,Come on in.
27183,Chandler,Me? No. You?
27185,Chandler,So do I.
27186,Chandler,I'm gonna put on some music.
27188,Chandler,You look good.
27190,Chandler,"Well, why don't we move this into the bedroom?"
27192,Chandler,"Oh, do you not want to?"
27195,Chandler,"Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put lotion on her!"
27209,Chandler,"Oh, you're-you're going?"
27213,Chandler,Not if I kiss you first.
27215,Chandler,"Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss."
27217,Chandler,Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have sex with ya!
27219,Chandler,Because I'm in love with Monica!!
27229,Chandler,"Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet."
27238,Chandler,"Oh, I'm going on the lamb."
27242,Chandler,"Well, I think, I think Ross knows about me and Monica."
27245,Chandler,"Look, we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I'm in love with her."
27259,Chandler,"Yeah, big zero gravity moon steps."
27279,Chandler,"Hey listen, come on, Joey is having a problem! A little girl is beating him up."
27319,Chandler,"Very, very funny, but don't say things like that in front of Monica. I don't want you putting any ideas in her head."
27323,Chandler,"Yeah, so, what's that supposed to mean?!"
27325,Chandler,"I don't see it that way. Okay? Because, I see two Monicas, the one that was my friend, who lived across the hall, and wanted to have a lot of babies and then the new Monica, who I just started to date. Now, who's to say what she wants?! IÂ’m right. I'm right. Am I right?"
27327,Chandler,"Okay. It's not different at all, is it?"
27339,Chandler,"Yeah, I'm cool. Casual."
27341,Chandler,"I'm just hanging out. Y'know, having fun. Y'know with the girl that I'm seeing casually."
27345,Chandler,"Well, you do want all that stuff, right?"
27347,Chandler,Yes! You want babies! You have baby fever!
27349,Chandler,"Oh please, you are obsessed with babies and-and marriage and everything that's related to babies and-and marriage! I've got an idea, why don't we turn down the heat on this pressure cooker?!"
27351,Chandler,Nah-uh! I know you! Okay? I know the thoughts that you have in the head--in your head!
27353,Chandler,"Well, I did not know that."
27354,Chandler,"It's gonna be okay, right? I mean she's not gonna leave me? This is, this is fixable."
27364,Chandler,Just tell me what I need to do to make things right.
27366,Chandler,"Well, that's what we do. Y'know, I-I mess up and then you tell me how to fix it and then I do and then y'know you think I'm all cute again."
27429,Chandler,Where's Monica?! Where is she? I need to talk to her! It's urgent! Is she here?
27431,Chandler,"I need to talk to you, it's urgent!"
27437,Chandler,Will you marry me?
27442,Chandler,I don't know. But I know I'm not afraid to do this.
27444,Chandler,I'm doing this because I'm sorry?
27448,Chandler,"Yeah, I'm kinda wishing everyone wasn't here right now."
27456,Chandler,I didn't think I was!
27465,Chandler,"Okay, how long is this going to go on."
27468,Chandler,That's not funny.
27475,Chandler,"Oh, we wanted to finish the crossword before we went to bed. Hey, do you know a six-letter word for red?"
27502,Chandler,"Oh, y'know what? The last time Joey went to a meadow, his mother was shot by a hunter."
27563,Chandler,"Okay, but impersonating a police officer is a serious thing. You could get arrested."
27573,Chandler,"Oh, come on! You've been acting strange all day!"
27584,Chandler,"No, it can mean anything. Like uh, all of the sudden you're jealous because I've become the apartment stud."
27589,Chandler,"Joey, look, are you attracted to Monica? Right here, right now, are you attracted to her?"
27591,Chandler,Well there you have it!
27594,Chandler,"Well y'know, Monica and I were friends before we started dating. So maybe-maybe that's it?"
27599,Chandler,"Oh yeah, it's actually in my bedroom."
27648,Chandler,"Y'know, I would be offended, but Monica is freakishly strong, so"
27665,Chandler,"Okay, I don't think we can turn anymore!"
27668,Chandler,Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!!
27671,Chandler,"Okay, yeah, I think it's really stuck now."
27674,Chandler,"Oh, y'know, what did you mean when you said pivot?"
27687,Chandler,"Ooh, I do! I do! I do!"
27786,Chandler,"Oh hey, how'd the interview go?"
27790,Chandler,So what happened?
27796,Chandler,"Well you coulda tried, not kissing him."
27806,Chandler,"Come on, Rach."
27856,Chandler,"Monica, you have got to stop this competitive thing! Okay? It's crazy. {Finally! The voice of reason.} I mean, just impress Gary and Phoebe we have to go upstairs and have sex over and over and I'm saying no to this, why? Get your coat."
27874,Chandler,That was amazing!
27876,Chandler,That was amazing.
27878,Chandler,"No, you're the best."
27880,Chandler,"No, you're the best."
27910,Chandler,"Honey, the tortilla chips know what you mean."
27924,Chandler,"No. And if I did, I don't think we'd be going out. Monica, this is getting ridiculous!"
27926,Chandler,"Ugh, we have already proved that we are hot! Okay? So why-why are you getting so obsessed about this thing?!"
27930,Chandler,Oh wow! Is that what this all have been about?
27932,Chandler,"Yeah that was great. That was really great! But to tell you the truth, I'm more excited about where we are right now."
27938,Chandler,Y'know what I just realized? You just freaked out about our relationship.
27940,Chandler,Yes you did! Admit it! You freaked out!
27967,Chandler,"Hey Rach, now that you're working at Ralph Lauren, can you bring me back some of those polo shirts?"
27969,Chandler,"Unwilling to steal from work, interesting."
27983,Chandler,Dude! That's my girlfriend!
28017,Chandler,"Yeah, it is the best."
28021,Chandler,"Yeah, or you can do the easy thing and smoke."
28027,Chandler,"Yeah, I wanna go to babe."
28085,Chandler,Ah sure. What's in 'em?
28087,Chandler,"Oh good, because uh we got Rachel 800 gallons of water."
28090,Chandler,Y'know I rued the day onceÂ…didn't get a whole lot else done.
28122,Chandler,"Okay, there's something different though--Oh my God! You smoked!"
28124,Chandler,Yes you did! You look happy and sick; you smoked!
28126,Chandler,I wish I had smoked for my career
28129,Chandler,"Okay, but you gotta push past this because it is about to get so good!"
28187,Chandler,"Great job with the cups, Pheebs!"
28230,Chandler,"Monica and I are celebrating our ten-month anniversary, we've got reservations at Ja George."
28232,Chandler,"Made a few calls, pulled some strings, and they agreed to seat us at 11:30 if we both had the chicken and didn't get desert."
28233,Chandler,Hey Caitlin! Somebody got a haircut.
28235,Chandler,"Yeah, if that was true, gym class would've been a lot more interesting."
28239,Chandler,"Oh, he's in the back. The duck pissed him off, said that eggs came first."
28245,Chandler,I was not flirting.
28247,Chandler,"Okay first of all, the impression, uncanny. And second, that was not flirting, that was just casual conversation between two people. That is all."
28255,Chandler,I was not flirting.
28259,Chandler,"I was not and oh God, shh!"
28263,Chandler,Is that what this is about? You like Caitlin?
28275,Chandler,"So, Joey on Law & Order, you must be very proud!"
28285,Chandler,The one that doesn't.
28287,Chandler,"Hey, why don't you wear those earrings I gave you?"
28312,Chandler,"If you said, ""Big lima bean, bubbling up."" Would she understand the difference?"
28343,Chandler,"Okay, but there is a big difference. You are a lot hotter than I am."
28346,Chandler,"Yes, it does bother me! And I think it would bother a lot of people. Rachel, when you were going out with Ross, did it bother you when he flirted with other women?"
28379,Chandler,"Doesn't know, ""Hello."" But she knows Capricorn One."
28394,Chandler,"So uh Monica, do you, do you like the Law & Order?"
28396,Chandler,"See, I'm finding out all this stuff about you today, like you like the Law & Order and that you flirted with every guy in the Tri-State area!"
28398,Chandler,"Oh, I'm so glad we cleared that up. Look, I'm sorry, some things are different for men and for women."
28400,Chandler,"Okay, I've already taught you so much already, but whatever. See when you flirt with a guy you think, ""I'm just flirting, no big deal."" But the guy is thinking, ""Finally! Somebody who wants to sleep with me!"""
28406,Chandler,All guys that are awake. Then we go to sleep and then all the guys from the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way.
28459,Chandler,Oh the humanity.
28465,Chandler,More so than anything else.
28495,Chandler,Almost over man.
28497,Chandler,Why am I looking?
28502,Chandler,You couldn't have at least changed your shirt.
28519,Chandler,You look amazing. I'm the luckiest man in the world.
28521,Chandler,Let me see the earrings.
28529,Chandler,"Hey man, what's up?"
28546,Chandler,"Yeah, yeah! Me too!"
28550,Chandler,"Well, I like danger."
28552,Chandler,Tonight? You-you didn't say it was going to be at nighttime.
28573,Chandler,It is starting to get dark out there.
28587,Chandler,Your tax dollars?
28591,Chandler,I can't smell your sandwich?
28610,Chandler,"Sur-surprise him? We're not, we're not gonna make anybody mad are we?"
28616,Chandler,How do you figure that?
28618,Chandler,"Y'know, when you say partner it doesn't sound cop. It, it sounds gay."
28624,Chandler,Look at Officer Ross riding back here with the visitors.
28640,Chandler,"Okay, y'know, we-we're safe right? I mean nothing bad can go down!"
28648,Chandler,What's going on?
28680,Chandler,Who jumps at loud noises!
28693,Chandler,"Oh, I just went for a walk, around the living room. Whatever"
28695,Chandler,"No. No I'm just tired. Y'know, from-from the walk."
28697,Chandler,You dove in front of Ross! Ross!
28699,Chandler,I do not hate Ross!
28703,Chandler,"Look I'm very glad that you saved Ross from the car backfire, but y'know, it could've been a bullet and you y'know, you didn't try to save me!"
28705,Chandler,"When it comes down to it, you would risk your life for Ross before you would for me. That's the bottom line."
28707,Chandler,From a bullet!
28711,Chandler,"So you risked your life, for a sandwich!"
28713,Chandler,"So you didn't uh, choose Ross before me."
28724,Chandler,I thought you were showing me how much you mean to me.
28775,Chandler,Before or after you were shot by your own troops?
28777,Chandler,"Yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches."
28786,Chandler,Hiya doin' pumpkin?
28808,Chandler,"So, what are you gonna do?"
28810,Chandler,Me?! Why me?
28812,Chandler,"I'll try, but I'm not sure what good it would do, y'know? Because I'm a lot less afraid of commitment than I used to be."
28863,Chandler,"Gary, I'm here to report a crime."
28865,Chandler,It is a crime that you and I don't spend more time together.
28867,Chandler,"Well, I heard that you thinking about asking Phoebe to move in with you and I thought maybe, we should have a talk. Man to uh, me."
28869,Chandler,"Uh, are you crazy? Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe, you two are gonna be y'know, live-living together!"
28871,Chandler,You mean scared.
28875,Chandler,"I am trying to open your eyes, my man! Don't you see, if you lived with Phoebe she's always gonna be there. You're gonna get home, she's there. You go to bed, she's there. You wake up and oh yes, she's there!"
28877,Chandler,"Were you're parents happy, or something?"
28879,Chandler,"Wow, y'know when you say it, it doesn't sound so scary."
28881,Chandler,"Yeah, I think I do! Y'know what? You move in with her! You move in with her right now! Maybe I should in with Monica!"
28921,Chandler,"Yes I did, and I think you should do it."
28923,Chandler,"He's a great guy, y'know? And he loves you a lot, you are a very lucky lady."
28952,Chandler,Four hours? You guys have been doing this for four hours?
28959,Chandler,I'm not a dropper!
28961,Chandler,It's throwing and catching!
28970,Chandler,Maybe that's because she's a minion of the anti-Christ.
28976,Chandler,"Yeah, you almost overreacted to something."
29044,Chandler,Not fun anymore?
29071,Chandler,"Come on! Gary's such a great guy! Whatever the problem is, you can work it out!"
29073,Chandler,Oh that is over!
29084,Chandler,You guys wanna eat here?
29097,Chandler,"Oh, Richard. That's all I ever hear, Richard, Richard, Richard!"
29099,Chandler,"Okay, so Richard, Richard!"
29115,Chandler,You okay there man?
29124,Chandler,"Wow umm, calm down."
29130,Chandler,"Uh, no Pheebs. What's it look like?"
29133,Chandler,You got the lead in a movie? That's amazing! What's the movie about?!
29137,Chandler,"Yeah, I know that means buddy!"
29140,Chandler,"Well, uh, we can talk about that too Pheebs."
29143,Chandler,"Whoa-whoa-whoa, what are we going to do about my job?"
29238,Chandler,"Hey, so where are we staying? Is the movie putting us up in a big hotel suite?"
29240,Chandler,"I see, but once you get your first paycheck you'll be springing a big hotel suite, right? I mean, lead in a movie, they must be paying you a lot?"
29242,Chandler,So you don't get paid unless the movie makes money?
29249,Chandler,"All right, bye-bye now!"
29276,Chandler,"We've been driving for a half-hour, and you haven't looked at the road once."
29280,Chandler,Isn't that Ross's money?
29282,Chandler,I don't know.
29294,Chandler,"I also said, ""Yes!"""
29298,Chandler,"Look Joe, I just, I just don't want to get your hopes up real high."
29300,Chandler,They're not even paying ya! This doesn't even sound like a real movie!
29302,Chandler,"Joe, I don't think this is going to be your big break."
29304,Chandler,"Oh, you don't want me on the trip?"
29306,Chandler,"All right, I'll tell ya what, the next time you ask me a question like that I'll lie."
29308,Chandler,"All right, fine! Fine! Why don't you pull over? I'll get out right now!"
29310,Chandler,You're not actually supposed to stop on the bridge.
29325,Chandler,Joey kicked me out of the car on the George Washington bridge!
29327,Chandler,"I don't know! He went crazy! Y'know, we were playing that game where you-you ask a question and you answer it really fast."
29329,Chandler,"Well, I don't know what mad him so mad, y'know? All I said was that uh, I didn't think this wasn't gonna be his big break, that this movie wasn't going to do anything for him, and that uh, y'know it didn't sound like a real movie--Okay, he should've pushed me off of the bridge."
29378,Chandler,"Y'know, he won't even talk to me. How am I going to apologize to him if he won't even talk to me?"
29450,Chandler,"No-no-no-no, I've supported you one hundred percent and I want to prove that to you in person!"
29452,Chandler,Forgive me? You haven't been taking my calls in a week!
29455,Chandler,"Uh, what was that?"
29480,Chandler,I know. Can you believe it? One year ago today I was just your annoying friend Chandler.
29484,Chandler,"Oh, but it's not 'til tomorrow!"
29490,Chandler,Do we have to?
29492,Chandler,"Okay this is great, but Joey said he didn't want any of us out there."
29494,Chandler,"Yeah, I think we should see other people."
29514,Chandler,I said art lover.
29516,Chandler,"I don't know, I'm very tired."
29527,Chandler,So it's pretty much the same Pheebs.
29529,Chandler,"Yeah, I guess it's a little better now."
29533,Chandler,Can I give you a present now?
29537,Chandler,"How do you feel about the, ""I really did forgot the present, please forgive me"" not fake out?"
29539,Chandler,Ohh that's the worse thing that can happen on an anniversary ever!
29541,Chandler,What-what Richard thing?
29543,Chandler,What Richard thing?
29578,Chandler,Oh my God.
29581,Chandler,Love your condoms my man.
29587,Chandler,Why?! What happened?!
29591,Chandler,"No-no, that's okay, apparently there's a new policy where we don't have to share everything with everybody."
29598,Chandler,No! Her boyfriend Richard!
29600,Chandler,When you go lunching with hunky moustache men and don't tell me about it!
29608,Chandler,There's not gonna be a next time! You can not ever see him again!
29610,Chandler,"That's so funny, because I think I just did!"
29612,Chandler,Fine with me!
29616,Chandler,What are you talking
29669,Chandler,What's an identical hand twin?
29675,Chandler,"Again I must go back to, how?"
29679,Chandler,"No! No! I support you 100%! I just didn't, I didn't get it right away. Y'know now I'm caught up! Identical hand twins! It's a million-dollar idea!"
29687,Chandler,That was Joey!
29689,Chandler,"Yeah, well, she's probably talking to Richard."
29752,Chandler,What does it look like? I'm going home.
29758,Chandler,"Yeah, I wanted to make a dramatic scene, but I hate packing."
29809,Chandler,Yes! I've-I've never seen a roll like this in my life!
29811,Chandler,"Okay, ah umm, ah, a 8. Ah, a 6?"
29815,Chandler,"If you get this one, we buy everybody here a steak dinner!"
29823,Chandler,"Ahh, ooh, try a hard 8."
29833,Chandler,Another hard 8.
29840,Chandler,You roll another hard eight and we get married here tonight.
29842,Chandler,Yes! I love you! I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
29844,Chandler,"Okay, so if an eight comes up, we take it as a sign and we do it! {Whoa! Where have I heard that before? Matthew Perry talking about signs in Las Vegas. I guess it must've been some movie I saw.} What do you say?"
29846,Chandler,Okay! Come on! Let's go! All right!
29851,Chandler,Here it is! Here it is!
29853,Chandler,It's a four.
29908,Chandler,"Ohh, great, I have condom in my wallet I've had since I was twelve."
29910,Chandler,I don't think so.
29914,Chandler,"No, we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress."
29936,Chandler,Hello! One marriage please!
29941,Chandler,"Oh, that's The Wedding March. Does, does that freak you out?"
29949,Chandler,Oh my God!
29952,Chandler,Oh my God!! Is everybody getting married?!!
29959,Chandler,Yes! Well that-yes.
29962,Chandler,We actually missed it.
29998,Chandler,"So, has anyone talked to Dr. and Mrs. Geller yet?"
30001,Chandler,ItÂ’s a buffet man.
30003,Chandler,"Listen, I gotta talk to you."
30005,Chandler,Monica and I almost got married last night.
30007,Chandler,"Look, I just donÂ’t think Monica and I are ready to get married yet! YÂ’know? I mean, I love her and everything but seeing Ross and Rachel coming out of that chapel was like a, like a wake-up call that Monica and I are moving so fast. YÂ’know? And, how do I tell her without crushing her?"
30021,Chandler,Are we gonna talk about what you guys did last night? Or
30038,Chandler,"Well, I think, I think, Ross already has one. Now, this oneÂ’s free, right? Because you paid for the first two, so the third oneÂ’s free."
30048,Chandler,I donÂ’t know. But I-I-I know I love you!
30050,Chandler,So where are we on the whole going back to the place where they have all the marriages thing? I love you.
30063,Chandler,"That was so unlikely. Well, letÂ’s get married! I guess."
30065,Chandler,"ThatÂ’s right! It was the wrong kind of eight, no wedding! Damnit!"
30098,Chandler,Well you did pull his hair.
30100,Chandler,IÂ’m not getting into this again!
30142,Chandler,"All right, should we just, should we just get married? YÂ’know? I mean should we just do it? All the signs are telling us to do it."
30151,Chandler,"Well, what if all my stuff was here?"
30153,Chandler,Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what IÂ’m saying?
30155,Chandler,Me asking is kind of a sign.
30165,Chandler,"Okay, a little problem. The key broke in the lock and I canÂ’t get in!"
30167,Chandler,This is not a sign!
30169,Chandler,ItÂ’s an old key!
30171,Chandler,I love you!
30173,Chandler,Are you hugging the door right now.
30175,Chandler,"Yeah-yeah, me neither."
30190,Chandler,The keyÂ’s stuck in the lock.
30195,Chandler,Nice job Joe! YouÂ’re quite the craftsmen.
30230,Chandler,"YÂ’know when we move in together, can I get a gumball machine?"
30232,Chandler,"No. When it comes to sweets, heÂ’s surprisingly strict."
30234,Chandler,"No, no, I keep trying, yÂ’know? I can get out, ""Joey, I have tooÂ…"" but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, ""Â…go to the bathroom."" He may think IÂ’m sick."
30236,Chandler,"Oh, so thatÂ’s this is gonna work now? YouÂ’re just gonna order me around all the time?"
30248,Chandler,"Look, I-IÂ’m just gonna be right across the hall and I promise you, the minute Monica and I break up IÂ’m moving right back in with you!"
30282,Chandler,"Okay, so thatÂ’s it, everybody knows! ItÂ’s official, weÂ’re moving in together. No turning back. Are ya scared? Are ya?"
30284,Chandler,Wow that was my scariest voice! YouÂ’re very brave.
30290,Chandler,"Well, I-I still think youÂ’re very-very nice and very pretty"
30322,Chandler,"Okay, when are we gonna tell Rachel what is actually gonna happen?"
30324,Chandler,"Well, JoeyÂ’s my best friend."
30326,Chandler,You just saidÂ… Of course youÂ’re my best friend. Would you please tell Rachel though?
30332,Chandler,I am now!
30350,Chandler,"Look, IÂ’m just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff."
30352,Chandler,Not once did we do that.
30357,Chandler,"Oh yeah? Well, howÂ’d she take it?"
30359,Chandler,And youÂ’re upset because you didnÂ’t make your best friend cry?
30362,Chandler,"Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?!"
30454,Chandler,"Pheebs, I donÂ’t understand. How can you have a roommate that none of us know anything about?"
30460,Chandler,Hey-hey! I thought Naked ThursdayÂ’s was just our thing man!
30483,Chandler,Who was it?
30488,Chandler,"Well, I like that idea. Obviously! I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, yÂ’know? I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like Space Invaders and Asteroids for $200, the real ones! The big-big ones!"
30490,Chandler,"Okay so you mean no as in, ""Gee Chandler, what an interesting idea. LetÂ’s discuss it before we reject it completely."""
30492,Chandler,"So, thatÂ’s it?"
30494,Chandler,Which is why Asteroids is perfect! ItÂ’s the oldest game!
30496,Chandler,"I donÂ’t have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!"
30500,Chandler,"Nothing, Monica and I had a stupid fight."
30550,Chandler,ThatÂ’s a great idea! We can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room.
30552,Chandler,We donÂ’t have to come up with this now.
30554,Chandler,"Hey, yÂ’know what? Why donÂ’t we think about changes we can make in the living room?"
30558,Chandler,Is that a problem?
30560,Chandler,"Oh, thatÂ’s cool. Then IÂ’ll just bring them both over."
30562,Chandler,"Okay, I get it. So, I get nothing! Nothing here is mine! Everything here is yours! IÂ’ll get up in the morning put on your clothes, and head off to work!"
30564,Chandler,In the game room!
30572,Chandler,Why did you take the shower curtain down?
30587,Chandler,"Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love."
30591,Chandler,I donÂ’t know.
30593,Chandler,"Yeah, I do."
30623,Chandler,"HeÂ’s being silly, because he knows that we enjoy the silliness!"
30627,Chandler,"Yeah, I'm not so worried."
30633,Chandler,Scared me out of ever wanting to live with him.
30636,Chandler,Oh my God! SomeoneÂ’s killed Square Man!
30638,Chandler,Oh thatÂ’s so sweet! I want to show you something too!
30640,Chandler,"YÂ’know those big-big uh, road signs that say ""Merge?"""
30642,Chandler,"YÂ’know? So I was thinking that we could get one of those signs and hang it over our bed. Because, thatÂ’s you and I together! Merge!"
30722,Chandler,"Oh, whatÂ’s the matter?"
30732,Chandler,Just out of curiosity did she tell you how youÂ’re gonna go?
30745,Chandler,Why donÂ’t you open with a joke?
30747,Chandler,"Wait a minute, hold the phone! YouÂ’re not talking about Chuckles University?!"
30757,Chandler,ThatÂ’s the way I did it Â‘til I was 19.
30760,Chandler,"Yes, you got something from the Screen ActorÂ’s Guild."
30764,Chandler,"Okay, itÂ’s not a check. TheyÂ’re saying your health insurance expired because, you didnÂ’t work enough last year."
30770,Chandler,"Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street."
30808,Chandler,"ThatÂ’s great, but shouldnÂ’t you be on the toilet right now?"
30810,Chandler,WhatÂ’s wrong with you?
30812,Chandler,This sounds like a hernia. You have toÂ—you-you go to the doctor!
30814,Chandler,ThatÂ’s a hernia.
30835,Chandler,I will loan you the money. Just go to the hospital and letÂ’s just get that thingÂ…pushed back in.
30841,Chandler,"Oh JoeyÂ’s got a really bad hernia, but thatÂ’s nothing a little laser eye surgery wonÂ’t fix!"
30889,Chandler,"Listen, IÂ’m really glad you got the part."
30891,Chandler,But are you sure you can do this?
30893,Chandler,"Now, is that never talking about it again?!"
30928,Chandler,What are you doing?
30930,Chandler,"Oh, all right."
30939,Chandler,"Okay, let me just jump in and ask, at what point did you think this was a successful marriage?"
30944,Chandler,"Ross, just for my own piece of mind, youÂ’re not married to anymore of us are ya?"
30950,Chandler,You left a shoe here?!
30952,Chandler,"Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, IÂ’ll be sure to give him your shoe."
30961,Chandler,"Yeah, IÂ’m gonna pass. Â‘Cause I was kinda iffy when it was puppies."
30997,Chandler,See thatÂ’s where I think that youÂ’re wrong. WeÂ’ve been playing these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense.
31001,Chandler,"Okay, IÂ’m a rookie. I should not be in the end zone."
31008,Chandler,Shocking! Since you still have the keys.
31010,Chandler,What equity investments?
31013,Chandler,You donÂ’t even have a car!
31017,Chandler,There you are.
31041,Chandler,He can do more than that! He can destroy the universe!
31043,Chandler,"TheyÂ’re not gonna swallow anything, you guys are being way over protective. When I was a kid, my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass!"
31052,Chandler,I swallowed the sonic blaster gun.
31088,Chandler,But you found the keys to his clothes?
31092,Chandler,That is true.
31097,Chandler,"Ahh, I think it just moved. ItÂ’s really poking me."
31104,Chandler,I think thatÂ’s gum.
31106,Chandler,"Okay, listen this really hurts. LetÂ’s go."
31122,Chandler,"Well, letÂ’s just say that Krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours."
31124,Chandler,And protected them from a tornado?
31130,Chandler,Was the setting of PhoebeÂ’s triumph.
31132,Chandler,Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.
31173,Chandler,First of the month.
31175,Chandler,"No, just the months you actually want to live here."
31179,Chandler,"ThatÂ’s our phone number. Now look, I know I kinda sprung this whole me moving out on thing, so why donÂ’t I justÂ—why donÂ’t I just cover you for a while?"
31181,Chandler,"ItÂ’s not charity, Joe"
31186,Chandler,"So, weÂ’ll do the rest of the bills later then?"
31188,Chandler,"No, I hope not! I tried to offer him some money, but he wouldnÂ’t take it."
31190,Chandler,"I figure that $1,500 would cover him for a few months, yÂ’know? But I have to trick him into taking it so I wonÂ’t hurt his pride."
31192,Chandler,Well that would help the pride thing.
31194,Chandler,Hey! Wow! You look great! Wanna move in with me tomorrow?
31205,Chandler,"Well, instead of just hanging out, we figure weÂ’d do nothing."
31231,Chandler,"Oh nope, I-I have plans with Joey."
31233,Chandler,"Yes, but for the last time."
31240,Chandler,HeÂ’s at a dinner party.
31246,Chandler,"Oh, I wish IÂ’d know you were going to do that, I ordered Chinese."
31248,Chandler,"Say, Joe, I had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night. What do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money?"
31250,Chandler,Yes it would. What do you say to $50?
31252,Chandler,"Okay, letÂ’s play! The big game, Italy vs. China, apparently."
31277,Chandler,"Okay, give me a chance to win my money back. Okay? Sudden death, one goal, $1,000."
31284,Chandler,"See? Now, thatÂ’s why only the little fake men are supposed to do all the kicking."
31303,Chandler,"Okay, uh, how about, how aboutÂ—yÂ’know what? We could play a new game. A new game, itÂ’s fun."
31307,Chandler,"IÂ’ll teach ya! Come on, come on, itÂ’s really easy and really, really fun."
31311,Chandler,"Ho-ho, you win! 50 dollars!"
31315,Chandler,YouÂ’re kidding right?
31344,Chandler,"It doesnÂ’t matter because nothing beats a three and a six. That my friend is D-Cup. Okay, now much have you won so far?"
31346,Chandler,Not 700 exactly?
31350,Chandler,"Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it."
31381,Chandler,Wh-How did you lose at Cups?!
31385,Chandler,"All right, letÂ’s play one more hand! One more!"
31387,Chandler,I canÂ’t take the big white dog! You love it!
31391,Chandler,When did I try to give you money?
31393,Chandler,IÂ’m just trying to help you out! Okay? I wanna make sure that youÂ’re okay.
31414,Chandler,I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.
31418,Chandler,ItÂ’s not a real game! I made it up!
31420,Chandler,At a fake game!!
31422,Chandler,Okay! Now I assume the Saucer card came up when you played last.
31466,Chandler,I didn't nail the boxes to the floor.
31468,Chandler,"Yes, and while I'm doing that, Ross has a great computer story for you."
31477,Chandler,"So, uh, wh-where ya from?"
31492,Chandler,"Hey, look at all the boxes!"
31496,Chandler,"All right, think about it. Now remember when you were going out with that girl Donna and you guys broke up. Remember how horrible it was when you guys bumped into each other at the supermarket?"
31498,Chandler,Now imagine you live at the supermarket.
31530,Chandler,"Yeah, not bad right? You know what, MonicaÂ’s gonna be working late, so I'm gonna make this place spotless. You know what else I'm gonna do, know what else I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go downstairs, I'm gonna get her some flowers. Now who wouldn't wanna live with me?"
31532,Chandler,"Yeah, now how's that going though? Are you okay with the not-flirting thing?"
31547,Chandler,What does it look like I'm doing? I am cleaning!
31549,Chandler,Authorization? I don't need that. I'm gonna put everything back.
31553,Chandler,She's not gonna care if I put her stuff back in the same stupid place.
31555,Chandler,"She is gonna recognize that I did a nice thing and-and, appreciate it."
31557,Chandler,"I see, I see, y-y-you're trying to freak me out."
31561,Chandler,"Hey Mon, how's it going?"
31563,Chandler,"Oh come on, come on, it can't be that bad."
31565,Chandler,No! No-no-no-no-no-no. It sounds like they really need you down there.
31573,Chandler,"OK well here, we'll just move the coffee table closer to the couch."
31575,Chandler,"Yes, but the coffee table doesn't match the...blahebdmsdlkhdyslkd;btyds...Rooosss!!!!"
31580,Chandler,"Oh no, yes we do my man. Remember when we were back in college and we went to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could not stop talking about the Irish potato famine?"
31582,Chandler,"Yeah, Monica doesn't like that either, Maybe I should stop doing that."
31584,Chandler,That's not specific to girls.
31587,Chandler,And they don't like it when you explain why your jokes are funny.
31589,Chandler,"Man, I'm so lucky I have Monica."
31607,Chandler,"Okay, is this lamp in the same place?"
31619,Chandler,"Look, uh, just come later, we'll get everything squared away and you can come back later."
31621,Chandler,Bye! Thank God
31623,Chandler,"Look, we have no time okay? We must focus. We gotta get everything back into its original place."
31656,Chandler,"Okay look, don't...don't be mad okay? But after I unpacked the boxes I wanted to do something nice for you, so, I-I-I cleaned the apartment. So I moved everything around and then I forgot where it, where it went back and I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
31658,Chandler,Do you want me to be afraid of you?
31662,Chandler,Oh well you're the best. You come here to me.
31668,Chandler,Ba dum bumb cheshhh!
31671,Chandler,"Hi, my nameÂ’s Chandler. I just moved in next door and I was wondering if you would be interested in battling me in a post-apoplectic world for control of the galaxies last remaining energy source?"
31673,Chandler,"So, is Janine around?"
31675,Chandler,Can I check out what she did to my room?
31683,Chandler,"No! Ok, this is not good. You are a guy. Ok? This is a guys place. If you let this go, youÂ’re going to be sitting around with your fingers soaking in stuff."
31685,Chandler,Yes talk to her. Be a man.
31692,Chandler,"Hey, how was your breakfast with Hillary?"
31713,Chandler,ThatÂ’s weird. I donÂ’t think my boss likes me either.
31717,Chandler,Yeah letÂ’s head off to work.
31763,Chandler,You knowÂ…Oh My God.
31771,Chandler,"Yeah, what was wrong with your oldÂ…human teeth."
31785,Chandler,I am proud of all my friends today.
31787,Chandler,"Hi, IÂ’m Chandler. Your live-in boy"
31815,Chandler,"Yes, God forbid we throw out old underwear. You-you know what? IÂ’m going to go over to JoeyÂ’s."
31817,Chandler,"Yes, but I feel like IÂ’ve really gotten in touch with my feminine side enough today. You know. In fact I think weÂ’re two sachets away from becoming a lesbian couple."
31819,Chandler,"Nah, Nah, itÂ’s okay. I feel like I need to be in guy place. You know, do kind of like a man thing."
31821,Chandler,You know when guys hang out they donÂ’t just drink some beer and hammer up drywall?
31824,Chandler,"No thanks, Josephine.Scene: RossÂ’s apartment, Chandler enters. Ross is putting on makeup.]"
31825,Chandler,"Hey Ross, I was wondering ifÂ… Oh my God!! Where are all the men???Scene: Elevator at the Ralph Lauren offices, KimÂ’s waiting for it. The door opens and Rachel is inside.]"
31854,Chandler,"Monica, could you excuse us for a second? I need to talk to the girl with the flowers."
31857,Chandler,What is the matter with you ?!?
31861,Chandler,YouÂ’re turning into a women.
31863,Chandler,Now IÂ’ve upset you? What did I say?
31921,Chandler,Sydney Portier? Hehheh.
31923,Chandler,"Oh! ThatÂ’s great, they havenÂ’t seen the place since I moved in!"
31927,Chandler,Why havenÂ’t you told them?!
31929,Chandler,Why havenÂ’t you told them?! WouldnÂ’t they be happy?!
31931,Chandler,Why wouldnÂ’t they be happy?
31933,Chandler,What? What? Why?!
31935,Chandler,Is this why they donÂ’t like me or why you donÂ’t like me?
31937,Chandler,"YÂ’know, itÂ’ll be okay. ItÂ’ll be okay. Because when they come over, I will be all charming, I will make them fall in love with me, and then weÂ’ll tell Â‘em."
31939,Chandler,"Hey, I can be pretty charming, babe, I won YOU over, didnÂ’t I?"
31943,Chandler,Well Monica just told me that they donÂ’t.
31948,Chandler,"This is great, another Thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for."
31950,Chandler,Maybe I could give thanks by taking my Playstation over to my new apartment.
31952,Chandler,[mocks that last comment].
32004,Chandler,"Mr. and Mrs. Geller, you look wonderful, it is great to have you hear, let us take off your coats!"
32005,Chandler,"Whoa, snowing out there?"
32016,Chandler,"Yeah, Ross sure is a great guy, yÂ’know IÂ’ve always felt that how a young man turns out is a reflection on his father."
32047,Chandler,"Oh, yes. Well itÂ’s very beautiful. ItÂ’s cream-colored and tight [Realizes what he just said and looks worried. Monica and Ross also looked shocked. Judy and Jack give Chandler a very dirty look.] I donÂ’t mean tight, I mean itÂ’s not too tight, not that I was looking at-[giving up all hope, he puts his head into his hands.]"
32054,Chandler,You do? Why?
32056,Chandler,What?! Why did you do that?
32058,Chandler,How could it not matter?!
32060,Chandler,What about all that Â“friends foreverÂ” stuff?
32063,Chandler,Your parents caught Ross smoking pot in college and he blamed it on me!
32065,Chandler,"The reason we havenÂ’t told them weÂ’re together is because they hate me, okay? So will you fix this?"
32102,Chandler,"Yeah, IÂ’m not gonna pay for those acting classes anymore."
32173,Chandler,"Let me ask you, why is everybody using these tiny lights nowadays? I remember when people used to use big lights."
32180,Chandler,"I dunno what it is, it just doesnÂ’t quite feel like Christmas to me."
32182,Chandler,See now it feels like Christmas!
32186,Chandler,Hey Joe whatÂ’s up?
32188,Chandler,I can see why thatÂ’s hard to resist.
32192,Chandler,"You are aware that sheÂ’s not a monkey, right?"
32210,Chandler,"What, what are you laughing at?"
32216,Chandler,I donÂ’t think so.
32236,Chandler,"I can save you time ladies, IÂ’m right here."
32239,Chandler,What? ThatÂ’s terrible!
32241,Chandler,"Oh well, that makes it not terrible."
32244,Chandler,"No not okay, you canÂ’t look for MonicaÂ’s presents!"
32246,Chandler,"No, you donÂ’t have to, and you canÂ’t because I live here too."
32250,Chandler,"No, I have a great idea for a present for her."
32253,Chandler,"If I help, we can find Â‘em faster!"
32261,Chandler,"YÂ’know when you guys said you were gonna go across the hall and look, you donÂ’t, you donÂ’t do that every year do you?"
32263,Chandler,"You donÂ’t, like go into the back of my closet, and look under my gym bag or anything?"
32287,Chandler,"I couldn't find anything at Joey--Hey-hey, oh hey!"
32290,Chandler,"Those are my gifts, I got them for you."
32293,Chandler,Those are book ends! That's a great gift!
32296,Chandler,"Make sure you put all that stuff back in the closet, okay?"
32349,Chandler,"Oh, hey guys!"
32351,Chandler,"Yes, if the presents are hidden south for the winter."
32353,Chandler,"Oh, the duck seems to think that Monica got me garbage! Hmm, I wonder what I could get Monica thatÂ’s as good as garbage?"
32366,Chandler,Okay! Okay! Okay!
32368,Chandler,"Wait, we canÂ’t do this."
32370,Chandler,"I donÂ’t wanna know what Monica got me. YÂ’know? I mean, look, IÂ’m sure she worked really hard at getting you a present, and wanting to surprise me, and you guys are gonna ruin that, and I, look we have to put these back, this is not what Christmas is about."
32372,Chandler,"Nobody is opening anything ok? Look, I donÂ’t know about you guys, but I wanna see the look on MonicaÂ’s face when I give her my present, and IÂ’m sure she wants to see the look on my face when I get mine. So please, please, can we just, can we put them back?"
32376,Chandler,ThatÂ’s what you got me?
32402,Chandler,"Now you do that, youÂ’re on TV."
32417,Chandler,"So you kissed her, so what happened after that?"
32419,Chandler,So sheÂ’s just waiting over there for ya?
32433,Chandler,IÂ’m not your garbage man. IÂ’m your mailman.
32440,Chandler,You took off your pants and climbed under the sheets!
32447,Chandler,You made pottery?
32451,Chandler,"Ahh, just like the apothecary tables of yore"
32454,Chandler,"Look at us, weÂ’re a couple of couples!"
32540,Chandler,Oh thatÂ’s too bad.
32545,Chandler,"ThatÂ’s funny, I saw no phlegm."
32547,Chandler,Then why-why is she going to a play?!
32551,Chandler,"Well, why does she not want to hang out with us?!"
32554,Chandler,So she was just pretending to have a good time last night? She was lying to our faces?!
32556,Chandler,"And I am not blah, I am a hoot!"
32558,Chandler,"No, you shÂ—No you said you made that up!!"
32583,Chandler,"Okay, one more time."
32590,Chandler,"Oh nothing, weÂ’re just talking. YÂ’know, blah-blah-blah."
32642,Chandler,ThatÂ’s totally understandable.
32677,Chandler,Did you hear that?
32683,Chandler,"Hey so, did uh, did she move out?"
32699,Chandler,That is funny. It was also funny when I made it up.
32701,Chandler,I made that joke up.
32703,Chandler,"Yes, I did. I told it to Dan at work, and he said it was the funniest joke heÂ’d ever heard."
32707,Chandler,"Monica, you remember me telling you that joke, right?"
32712,Chandler,"Yeah, I guess."
32716,Chandler,ItÂ’s my joke.
32719,Chandler,"Dude, you have got to turn on Behind the Music. The band Heart is having a really tough time, and I think they may break up."
32721,Chandler,"Nah, MonicaÂ’s watching some cooking show. Come on, I donÂ’t want to miss when they were skinny."
32725,Chandler,"Joey, why is your cable out?"
32727,Chandler,"If you need money, will you please-please just let me loan you some money?"
32754,Chandler,"So, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it."
32757,Chandler,And monkeys canÂ’t write out prescriptions.
32760,Chandler,"So, you stole my joke, and you stole my money."
32762,Chandler,"Well, she is going to know that you stole the joke."
32778,Chandler,"You know who else picked Rachel? Ross, and you know what else Ross did? He stole my joke. You know what? IÂ’m going to get a joke journal. YÂ’know? And document the date and time of every single one of my jokes."
32784,Chandler,Maybe itÂ’s the sound of Ross climbing into my brain and stealing my thoughts.
32830,Chandler,So is your apron. YouÂ’re wearing it like a cape.
32872,Chandler,ItÂ’s my joke.
32874,Chandler,LetÂ’s have Monica decide.
32878,Chandler,"Mon, get out here!"
32880,Chandler,"Okay, okay. You have to help us decide whose joke this is."
32882,Chandler,Because youÂ’re the only one that can be fair.
32889,Chandler,"Okay, I thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with Steve."
32891,Chandler,Can I finish my story?!
32897,Chandler,IÂ’m not arguing with that.
32903,Chandler,"Hi, oh hi."
32913,Chandler,"IÂ’m sorry. YouÂ’re not easy-going, but youÂ’re passionate, and thatÂ’s good. And when you get upset about the little things, I think that IÂ’m pretty good about making you feel better about that. And thatÂ’s good too. So, they can say that youÂ’re high maintenance, but itÂ’s okay, because I like Â… maintaining you."
32918,Chandler,"Hey, buddy boy, howÂ’d the audition go?"
32945,Chandler,This coming from the man who couldnÂ’t split our 80 dollar phone bill in half.
32963,Chandler,"Hey, what are you doing here? ShouldnÂ’t you be at work?"
32966,Chandler,IÂ’m so sorry youÂ’re sick.
32970,Chandler,IÂ’m gonna grab you some tissue.
32978,Chandler,"Oh my God, introduce us!"
33066,Chandler,"Yeah, I donÂ’t you should say that even when youÂ’re healthy."
33068,Chandler,DonÂ’t take this personally okay? ItÂ’s just that I just canÂ’t have sex with a sick person.
33070,Chandler,"ThatÂ’s the thing, see I would like to stay in the pribe of mwha-ah-libe."
33124,Chandler,"Oh Jeez honey, I thought, I thought you were asleep."
33128,Chandler,Would you please get some rest!
33148,Chandler,Really? Struck down in the pribe of libe!
33150,Chandler,"No-no-no-no-no-no-no, you are not getting me this way."
33155,Chandler,"So youÂ’re just, kinda rubbing it on yourself?"
33163,Chandler,Oh come on you big faker!
33165,Chandler,Well that was before all the vaporizing action.
33190,Chandler,We got some Vap-O-Rub in some places.
33196,Chandler,HeÂ’s taking off her coat!
33213,Chandler,That was like 5 years ago.
33247,Chandler,Yes it was very sad when the guy stopped drawing the deer!
33249,Chandler,IÂ’m not macho.
33251,Chandler,"No, I guess I just never really cried. YÂ’know? IÂ’m not a crying kind of guy."
33253,Chandler,"IÂ’d be sad sure, but I wouldnÂ’t cry."
33255,Chandler,"Cry?! I just found a talking puppy, IÂ’m rich!"
33258,Chandler,"Oh, thatÂ’s ParentÂ’s Day, first grade. ThatÂ’s me with the janitor Martin."
33260,Chandler,Oh they didnÂ’t want to come!
33264,Chandler,"No! Look, I donÂ’t cry! ItÂ’s not a big deal! Okay?!"
33317,Chandler,You didnÂ’t get more movies that are gonna have us reaching for the tissues all night did you?
33322,Chandler,Phoebe Buffay in Buffay: The Vampire Layer.
33329,Chandler,"Hey, I had a terrible childhood and I donÂ’t do porn."
33345,Chandler,Her ankle is what youÂ’re watching?
33347,Chandler,SheÂ’s just doing her job!
33355,Chandler,ThereÂ’s no back to this couch!
33357,Chandler,"Yeah I know, but I figured a shot yÂ’know? Maybe one of those stories would make me cry and then you wouldnÂ’t think I was yÂ’know, all dead inside."
33359,Chandler,Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.
33365,Chandler,"Okay, well I wonÂ’t uh, worry about this anymore then."
33367,Chandler,"Aww, I love you so"
33371,Chandler,So you didnÂ’t mean any of that?!
33475,Chandler,Maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara-tay.
33477,Chandler,Sure I would!
33479,Chandler,"What, you guys really think that IÂ’m that shallow?"
33482,Chandler,"What if I had had the guts to quit my job? IÂ’d probably be writing for the New Yorker, getting paid to be funny. But my jobÂ’s fun too! I mean tomorrow, I-I donÂ’t have to wear a tie."
33524,Chandler,"Oh I just got another rejection letter. They said my writing was funny, just not ""Archie Comic funny."""
33530,Chandler,Was his question whatÂ’s more boring than him?
33532,Chandler,"Hey, I may have no money, but I still have my pride."
33539,Chandler,I could use the money; it could give me time to write.
33567,Chandler,Well itÂ’s kinda hard to be friends with Drake because of his busy schedule and the fact that heÂ’s not real.
33583,Chandler,"Uh-oh, itÂ’s my boss!"
33592,Chandler,But the Kit-Kats are all right?!
33596,Chandler,"Phoebe, are you having a heart attack?!"
33626,Chandler,"Oh just great. He beeps me now with codes. One is, ""Bring me food."" Two is, ""IÂ’m with a girl, bring us food."" Three is, ""IÂ’m lost and I canÂ’t find food."""
33645,Chandler,"IÂ’m sorry, I guess I just like the pulp."
33649,Chandler,"Okay, anything for you sir?"
33666,Chandler,Who sold a story to Archie Comics?!
33670,Chandler,You wanna share it?
33680,Chandler,"Oh you wouldnÂ’t uh, care. ItÂ’s just a stupid comic book story."
33746,Chandler,"No, the doctors say it may kill her."
33751,Chandler,"Listen Phoebe, heÂ’s right. People are not supposed to have heart attacks at 31."
33755,Chandler,"Uh, what about yÂ’know the massage thing? That never gave you a heart attack."
33794,Chandler,IÂ’m sorry youÂ’re here with me instead of Roger.
33800,Chandler,What was tonight?
33806,Chandler,Four different women! IÂ’ve had sex way more times!
33810,Chandler,"Well good, good for you. You really think that Roger is the perfect guy?"
33812,Chandler,Hey thatÂ’s what I tell girls about me.
33814,Chandler,No you are not! You are sweet and wonderful and this is gonna happen for you.
33818,Chandler,So was I.
33829,Chandler,We canÂ’t do this.
33833,Chandler,I do like that.
33835,Chandler,"Well, if it helps there were only three. So it would just be for tonight, right?"
33837,Chandler,Stop it! WeÂ’re doing this! LetÂ’s do it!
33841,Chandler,I have some moves.
33843,Chandler,"Yeah, letÂ’s just forget it."
33850,Chandler,Oh my God!
33913,Chandler,Let me tell you about this chick I scored with last night! Oh no wait a minute that was you!
33915,Chandler,"So you uh, want to do something tonight?"
33919,Chandler,"Yeah! Totally! Totally, and you?"
33921,Chandler,I bet he can.
33982,Chandler,"Yeah I know, guess who beeped him?"
33988,Chandler,"Yeah! When you were talking about Roger, that was killing me! Look, things like last night they donÂ’t just happen. YÂ’know? Or at least not to me. Or with the other two women, in the morning yÂ’know I was just lying there and I couldnÂ’t wait to just go hang out with my friends, but with you I always yÂ’know with a friend."
33990,Chandler,"I know you probably donÂ’t want to go out with me, yÂ’know because I make too many jokes and IÂ’ve never been in a serious relationship and I guess IÂ’m not technically a ""doctorÂ…"""
33992,Chandler,"No, there were two."
34003,Chandler,Twenty percent is a pretty generous tip Joe.
34005,Chandler,I see where youÂ’re goinÂ’!
34045,Chandler,"Hey-hey, is Monica here?"
34048,Chandler,"Okay, look I need your help, I donÂ’t know what to get her for ValentineÂ’s Day."
34059,Chandler,"Yeah, I thought so to until I paper mached one of my eyes shut."
34065,Chandler,"Well, have you guys made anything that maybe I can take credit for?"
34071,Chandler,"Hey! Honey, can I ask you a question about the ValentineÂ’s Day gifts?"
34073,Chandler,Do we have to make the entire thing?
34075,Chandler,"Of course, of course not. I just have to uh, go over to the place where I-I made it and pick-pick it up."
34104,Chandler,I canÂ’t figure out what to make Monica.
34106,Chandler,IÂ’m going crazy! Okay? Do you have any thing around here that looks homemade?
34108,Chandler,"Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me to the moon."
34110,Chandler,"Wait a minute, I canÂ’t give this to her."
34112,Chandler,"Because it says ""Captain Ross"" on the side and ""I hate Monica"" on the bottom."
34117,Chandler,"Hey! Hi! You uh, ready to exchange gifts?"
34119,Chandler,"Okay, come here! Come here."
34121,Chandler,"Now, itÂ’s not wrapped because I just, just finished it."
34123,Chandler,But I made you a tape of what I think are all romantic songs.
34131,Chandler,ItÂ’s a sock bunny.
34135,Chandler,"I see. YÂ’know umm, Phoebe makes sock bunnies."
34137,Chandler,"Oh, itÂ’s okay. I donÂ’t"
34142,Chandler,You are totally and completely 100% forgiven.
34146,Chandler,You have done enough!
34148,Chandler,"No you donÂ’tÂ—get it in black, not brown."
34151,Chandler,"Well, itÂ’s like that old saying, have some sex, eat some cake."
34157,Chandler,Who the hell is Carl?!
34159,Chandler,"YÂ’know sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you, arenÂ’t they?"
34187,Chandler,Oh my good God.
34189,Chandler,"Look, you have done enough! Okay? You have to stop this now."
34191,Chandler,"Oh, the mixed tape."
34209,Chandler,"I am so, so, so, so sorry!"
34213,Chandler,"Come on Monica, itÂ’s our ValentineÂ’s Day. Please? Please-please, please?"
34216,Chandler,"So, are we going in there?"
34227,Chandler,"Ahh, Hotties of the Paleontology Department, thereÂ’s a big selling calendar, eh?"
34233,Chandler,A hot girlÂ’s at stake and all of the sudden heÂ’s Rain Man.
34236,Chandler,"Oh, is that against the rules?"
34244,Chandler,"Oh yeah, Dana Keystone. She was in my Movement class."
34248,Chandler,"Oh, I donÂ’t know man. I havenÂ’t talked to her in like ten years."
34250,Chandler,"You do owe me so much. You owe me three thousand, four hundred"
34252,Chandler,"Oh okay, IÂ’ll-IÂ’ll try."
34254,Chandler,"Yeah so, Tuesday?"
34259,Chandler,You just thought of that in there?
34267,Chandler,What are you smiling about? What is so funny?
34287,Chandler,HowÂ’s your room Rach?
34294,Chandler,Have you figured out what started the fire Mr. Fireman?
34300,Chandler,"God, itÂ’s great to catch up! I canÂ’t believe how long itÂ’s been!"
34313,Chandler,"Honey, it is not a date! I havenÂ’t talked to her in ten years! You canÂ’t just call up somebody you havenÂ’t talked to in ten years and ask them for a favor. There are rules, yÂ’know? You gotta, you got to put in some time."
34315,Chandler,"No, we only went out once."
34324,Chandler,"Yeah, IÂ’ve always hated that Howie."
34326,Chandler,The nerve huh?
34389,Chandler,I couldnÂ’t do it.
34391,Chandler,"Hey, relax I just need more time. WeÂ’re going to dinner tonight."
34394,Chandler,"Uh, Dana Keystone from college."
34396,Chandler,"No, that was Dana Caplin."
34399,Chandler,Great story again! The yarns that you weave! Woo-hoo-hoo!
34401,Chandler,Oh no-no-no! Stay! Stay! Because you-you should you-you-you should stay!
34403,Chandler,"Oh no-no-no, thatÂ’s notÂ—No-no-no!"
34409,Chandler,Well maybe there is one thing you can do.
34411,Chandler,"Well, I umm, I mean this is just off the top of my head now, umm but I have this friend. This actor friend and he would kill me if he thought I was doing this umm, but umm would it be possible for him to get an audition for your movie say on Thursday?"
34494,Chandler,ItÂ’s Thursday! How was the audition?!
34521,Chandler,So he has to be a male who has at least $50.
34540,Chandler,"So, why is she leaving? Is it a school night and she has a lot of homework to do?"
34542,Chandler,"Oh, tell her good luck with that."
34556,Chandler,Yeah. Do we have any Fruit Roll-Ups?
34560,Chandler,Oh thatÂ’s so funny because we found someone too.
34562,Chandler,Why would our guy be a weirdo?
34568,Chandler,A face ass?
34572,Chandler,"No, our guy is just a floating head."
34582,Chandler,Our guy has great hair.
34584,Chandler,Our guy smells incredible.
34588,Chandler,"Well, youÂ…donÂ’t look good Joe."
34590,Chandler,ThatÂ’s still in there?!
34592,Chandler,Is this a service youÂ’re providing me?
34594,Chandler,Our new fridge? I donÂ’t live here anymore.
34617,Chandler,Just tell her the truth! Tell her youÂ’re not ready.
34619,Chandler,Then you distract her with a Barbie doll.
34625,Chandler,"Joey, I saw you push him!"
34672,Chandler,Are you sure?! Because our guy smells incredible!
34680,Chandler,Are you funny?
34691,Chandler,"Yeah, but Sebastian? What is that? A catÂ’s name?"
34696,Chandler,"Okay, so you will meet our guys?"
34698,Chandler,"Okay now it doesnÂ’t matter which one you choose, yÂ’know? ItÂ’s completely up to you. Our guy is perfect, or you can go out with the guy Phoebe deemed not good enough to go out with herself."
34708,Chandler,You know the hotels?
34717,Chandler,"Well, maybe you donÂ’t marry this one."
34799,Chandler,So what was it for anyway?
34827,Chandler,That is lucky.
34830,Chandler,"Now-now, why would you say that Joseph?"
34853,Chandler,"Oh, are we playing this?!"
34855,Chandler,Hey! HowÂ’d the audition go?
34860,Chandler,So it did go well.
34863,Chandler,Oh thatÂ’s great!
34865,Chandler,Oh my God!
34869,Chandler,"Oh-oh, what are you doing?"
34872,Chandler,"Well, it is overdue."
34914,Chandler,"Yeah okay, I was just talking to the guys. Just look at them I mean, is it okay if they come visit?"
34918,Chandler,As crazy as soccer?
34920,Chandler,You mean you didnÂ’t get it from this?
34922,Chandler,"Well, maybe we can fix it yÂ’know? Maybe we can send him some-some big-big flowers and scare him!"
34924,Chandler,"I messed up. Okay? IÂ’m sorry, I really messed up."
34926,Chandler,"Which I bought for ya. Taught ya how to use it. You thought it was a copier. Look, if there was anything I could do, I would do it. Okay? But everybodyÂ’s allowed one mistake, right?"
34927,Chandler,"You know he coulda gotten me a VCR, he coulda gotten me a set of golf clubs, but no, he has to get me the woman repeller! The eyesore from the Liberace house of crap!"
34929,Chandler,"Oh, yeah, easy for you to say, you don't have to walk around sporting some reject from the Mr. T collection. [Joey walks in behind Chandler]"
34931,Chandler,"I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry, I do, I do. I pity the fool that... [turns around and sees Joey] Hi!"
34932,Chandler,"Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking, and one thing to another and"
34934,Chandler,No! No! No! I just kissed her.
34936,Chandler,How is that worse?!
34938,Chandler,"YouÂ’re right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line."
34940,Chandler,"Look, IÂ’m not saying that you should magically forgive me! But youÂ’re not perfect! YouÂ’ve made some errors in judgment too!"
34944,Chandler,What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell is all of our stuff?!!
34946,Chandler,So--You got in voluntarily?!
34949,Chandler,"Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess."
34951,Chandler,...And what did you bring?
34956,Chandler,Joey's tailor...took advantage of me.
34959,Chandler,"Oh come on! He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite..."
34965,Chandler,I canÂ’t believe I did this! What an idiot!
34967,Chandler,Do you think heÂ’ll ever forgive me?
34969,Chandler,YÂ’know what? I-I kinda have.
34972,Chandler,"You didnÂ’t see how mad he was, yÂ’know?"
35002,Chandler,Oh my God!
35007,Chandler,Please tell me you got the message!
35009,Chandler,"The actor playing Mac couldnÂ’t do it, they needed to see you at 2 oÂ’clock."
35011,Chandler,"Du-du-I wrote it, I wrote it on the board! I wrote it on the board, then I went all over New York City looking for ya! I went to RossÂ’s! I went to the coffeehouse! I went to any place that they made sandwiches!"
35013,Chandler,Sorry! I-I-I donÂ’t know what to say.
35017,Chandler,"YÂ’know, sometimes that fake out thing is just mean!"
35019,Chandler,Well thatÂ’s good. Because you didnÂ’t! And IÂ’m incredibly happy for ya!!
35021,Chandler,"Oh, we could do this all day."
35023,Chandler,You are gonna be a huge star! IÂ’m gonna hug ya!
35027,Chandler,"I think so. Yeah, get off me."
35053,Chandler,Oh thatÂ’s right. ItÂ’s your first day! So are you psyched to fight fake crime with your robot sidekick?
35059,Chandler,Are you judging them by their covers? Because youÂ’re really not supposed to do that.
35072,Chandler,"Wait a minute, hold the phone! YouÂ’re not ElizabethÂ’s dad?!"
35123,Chandler,ThereÂ’s a Mr. Bing!
35138,Chandler,"Yes, we were just"
35142,Chandler,"Hey honey, you got the kind with the little girl, you said we were gonna to get the kind with the baby."
35144,Chandler,"No, the little girl creeps me out."
35146,Chandler,Why would the baby creep me out?
35149,Chandler,This is going in your book?
35179,Chandler,"Damn those robots, theyÂ’re supposed to be our faithful servants!"
35219,Chandler,"So do you think uh, JoeyÂ’s more charming than me?"
35258,Chandler,We said seven!
35260,Chandler,"The only way that I said six would be if the sevenÂ’s, let meet at seven, not at six."
35263,Chandler,Oh my good God.
35272,Chandler,"Thank you for writing your book. Its-its uh, great book and you are the queen of everything."
35276,Chandler,So you knew we were gonna miss the movie!
35281,Chandler,Oh IÂ’m so sorry man! Is there anything I can do?
35285,Chandler,"Hi, how are ya?"
35295,Chandler,"Yeah, IÂ’ve been there my friend."
35329,Chandler,IÂ’ll give up my ticket.
35332,Chandler,And I think Ross is generous too.
35557,Chandler,"Phoebe and Rachel! So the people that knew about our wedding before me were you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi, and apparently some band called Starlight Magic 7 who are available by the way!"
35561,Chandler,"Yes, if it really doesnÂ’t mean anything, because you know that IÂ’m just not ready"
35568,Chandler,"Yeah, itÂ’s beautiful."
35580,Chandler,"No, I donÂ’t want to tell anybody else because I donÂ’t want Monica to find out."
35582,Chandler,"Well, itÂ’s because I trust you, youÂ’re one of my best friends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures."
35588,Chandler,Oh all right.
35591,Chandler,"Oh well, we donÂ’t because we gotÂ…theÂ…other pl-place."
35664,Chandler,"YÂ’know, IÂ’m so glad I picked you to help me with this."
35669,Chandler,"Uh-uh, yes. I would like to see that ring please."
35672,Chandler,"Sir, can I ask you to umm, could youÂ…hold out that ring and ask me to marry you?"
35679,Chandler,"Yes! Yes, but I can only pay $8,000."
35718,Chandler,"No, did he hug you?!"
35720,Chandler,"Well, you can see my dad in Vegas kissing other dads."
35724,Chandler,IÂ’m a little busy here Paul.
35732,Chandler,Do you have my credit card?
35736,Chandler,"Oh, I canÂ’t go."
35739,Chandler,"Oh, thatÂ’s uh, thatÂ’s pretty nice but IÂ’m gonna go with the one I picked first."
35743,Chandler,They put you in jail?
35745,Chandler,"Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring!"
35747,Chandler,Yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring I got goose bumps.
35749,Chandler,It was the ring!
35780,Chandler,I canÂ’t believe I let you talk me into buying this stupid gumball machine looking ring!
35784,Chandler,I canÂ’t do that.
35787,Chandler,Okay and he hasnÂ’t proposed yet because she has no ring on her finger.
35789,Chandler,"Yeah! Okay, go, go, go get him."
35803,Chandler,"Yeah, sheÂ’s dyingÂ… Of a cough apparently."
35816,Chandler,"Yep, pretty much."
35824,Chandler,IÂ’m gonna ask Monica to marry me.
35828,Chandler,Check out the ring.
35841,Chandler,"Okay, well tonightÂ’s the big night."
35844,Chandler,"It is going to be perfect. I am taking her to her favorite restaurant. IÂ’m going to get her a bottle of the champagne that she really loves; therefore knows how expensive it is. Then when the glasses are full, instead of proposing a toast IÂ’m just gonna propose."
35849,Chandler,IÂ’m not gonna mess it up.
35851,Chandler,SheÂ’s not gonna say no.
35870,Chandler,I just get mad when Rachel doesnÂ’t remember where weÂ’re going.
35877,Chandler,"Well, you could also give back the money you owe me."
35882,Chandler,"Oh, so youÂ’re already doing your part for the kids."
35885,Chandler,"Wait a minute, all jokes aside? I didnÂ’t agree to that!"
35899,Chandler,"Okay, now will you guys get out of here? I want this is to be a surprise and sheÂ’s gonna know."
35964,Chandler,Yes! Yes! IÂ’m good! Are you good? Are you good? Is everythingÂ—are youÂ—are you perrr-perfect?!
35968,Chandler,"Yes! IÂ’m fine. In fact IÂ’ve been fine for a long time now and I think, the reason is you."
35970,Chandler,"Okay umm, before I meant you I had really little life and I couldnÂ’t imagine growing old with"
36027,Chandler,"I got a good one, I got a good one! I once walked in on both my parents making love to the same guy."
36036,Chandler,Oh you knew that. Good!
36052,Chandler,"Hey, you have to forget about Elizabeth. I mean if youÂ’re not careful you may not get married at all this year!"
36095,Chandler,Richard was there so I couldnÂ’t do it!
36097,Chandler,"IÂ’m gonna do it tomorrow yÂ’know, and-and surprise her, but now youÂ’ve ruined it!"
36099,Chandler,Who walks into a room and asks to see a personÂ’s hands?!
36103,Chandler,This is terrible. What am I going to do?
36105,Chandler,"ThatÂ’s right, I can throw her off. I can make her think marriage is the last thing on my mind."
36107,Chandler,"I can do that, IÂ’ve had 30 years of practice."
36128,Chandler,"Yeah, wellÂ… YÂ’know, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh?"
36174,Chandler,"Sure I do. In fact, I think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural. I mean look at pigs. LetÂ’s take a second here and look at pigs. Okay pigs donÂ’t mate for life. I mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a lifetime, and thatÂ’s just an ordinary pig not even a pig thatÂ’s good at sports!"
36176,Chandler,"If marriage worked, IÂ’d be all for it. But do you know what the divorce rate in this country is? 97%."
36178,Chandler,"Well, never say never but yÂ’know probably uh yeah, never."
36180,Chandler,Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What is all this pressure?! Is this some new kind of strategy? Why donÂ’t you put down your copy of Â‘The RulesÂ’ huh mantrap?!
36252,Chandler,I was making a coconut phone with the professor.
36256,Chandler,MyÂ—Oh my God!
36258,Chandler,HeÂ’s not supposed to ask my girlfriend to marry him! IÂ’m supposed to do that!
36344,Chandler,Well where did she go?
36346,Chandler,"Oh my God, I canÂ’t believe this! YÂ’know, I thoughtÂ…I thought you were a good guy."
36348,Chandler,Nothing happened? Nothing? So you didnÂ’t tell my girlfriend that you love her?
36350,Chandler,YÂ’know what? I canÂ’t believe this! Do you know what you did? My girlfriend is out there thinking things over! You made my girlfriend think!!
36352,Chandler,And what does she have to think about? I love her!
36354,Chandler,"But I am willing to offer her all those things. This was just a plan, yÂ’know? A way to throw her off course so that when I offered her all these things, sheÂ’d be surprised!"
36360,Chandler,YÂ’know RichardÂ…you are a good guy.
36363,Chandler,"I canÂ’t talk to you now, I gotta find Monica!"
36367,Chandler,What are you talking about?
36369,Chandler,Well why didnÂ’t you stop her?! Why didnÂ’t you just tell her it was a plan?!
36371,Chandler,Well whereÂ… Where did she go?
36373,Chandler,I canÂ’t believe I ruined this.
36376,Chandler,Oh my God.
36394,Chandler,Monica and I are engaged.
36414,Chandler,"So when you said, ""Get up early,"" did you mean 1986?"
36424,Chandler,Know what I mean?
36426,Chandler,ThereÂ’s gonna be a wedding. YouÂ’re gonna be the bride. Two hundred people are going to be looking at you in a clean white dress.
36436,Chandler,You look great!
36438,Chandler,You okay over there?
36440,Chandler,"Oh, donÂ’t worry about it I mean you probably were tired, you had a lot of champagne, it happens to everybody."
36478,Chandler,"Yes, on a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the dumbest a person can look, you are definitely 19."
36480,Chandler,"Young! YouÂ’re a man-child okay?! Now go get changed because everybodyÂ’s ready and please, oh please, keep my underwear!"
36484,Chandler,"Uhh, youÂ’ve had a lot of sex right?"
36486,Chandler,"Well, itÂ’s just the reason that IÂ’m asking is because I kind of eh, uh, I was unable toÂ—I mean I really wanted too, but I couldnÂ’tÂ…. There huhÂ—hmm, there-there was an incident."
36488,Chandler,ItÂ’s happened to you?
36490,Chandler,"Well, whatÂ’d you do?"
36533,Chandler,"Yes, you can pass for 19."
36537,Chandler,"Seriously? Seriously, no! You can play your own age which is 31!"
36567,Chandler,"Now Monica, I know youÂ’re upset, but donÂ’t forget. There is going to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and then thereÂ’s going to be a honeymoon, maybe in Paris."
36571,Chandler,"Then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love. Not just because itÂ’s romantic, but because I can!"
36574,Chandler,"Okay, donÂ’t say anything, you might scare it away."
36575,Chandler,"ItÂ’s Paris, who knows weÂ’re here!"
36580,Chandler,"Pheebs, weÂ’re not giving you a deposit for our wedding!"
36590,Chandler,"Oh, give her the deposit! Give her the ring! I donÂ’t care!"
36632,Chandler,How is that ever going to happen?!
36660,Chandler,WhatÂ’s the matter honey?
36667,Chandler,"Oh, I got some thoughts on that."
36671,Chandler,What in GodÂ’s name is that?!
36694,Chandler,Why are you napping over here instead of over at your place?
36698,Chandler,"Now, do I get to look at this book or is it just for people who are actually involved in the wedding?"
36751,Chandler,"Oh yeah, I should probably call them."
36753,Chandler,"Oh, I donÂ’t think I ever heard that story."
36757,Chandler,What a sweet story.
36785,Chandler,"Honey, itÂ’s gonna be okay."
36788,Chandler,"Look, it really is gonna be okay. The important thing is that we love each other and that weÂ’re gonna get married."
36792,Chandler,"Well, I have some."
36801,Chandler,"Well, youÂ’re not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the wedding?"
36802,Chandler,"Well, come on, IÂ’ve been saving this money for six years and I kinda had some of it earmarked for the future, not just for a party."
36805,Chandler,"No, I realize that honey, but IÂ’m not gonna spend all of the money on one party."
36807,Chandler,"Look, I understand, but I have to put my foot down. Okay? The answer is no."
36809,Chandler,"Yes, I am!"
36843,Chandler,"Look, I thought about it too, and IÂ’m sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding."
36845,Chandler,"Yeah, IÂ’m putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy then, then thatÂ’s what weÂ’re gonna do."
36847,Chandler,"Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids, yÂ’know? WeÂ’ll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college."
36851,Chandler,"Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy."
36853,Chandler,"Well, stuff like whereÂ’d we live, yÂ’know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. YÂ’know, we could have a cat that had a bell on itÂ’s collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, weÂ’d have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old."
36855,Chandler,Sure you do.
36859,Chandler,I love you so much.
36861,Chandler,"Oh yeah, totally!"
36880,Chandler,"Hey, you guys!"
36881,Chandler,"So, what do you think?"
36887,Chandler,I got glasses!
36889,Chandler,No I didnÂ’t!
36901,Chandler,"ThatÂ’s okay Pheebs, weÂ’re not having a party or anything, so you donÂ’t have to get us"
36908,Chandler,What we want honey.
36913,Chandler,Dying people say the craziest things.
36917,Chandler,Our kids are gonna be fat arenÂ’t they.
36919,Chandler,Hey! HowÂ’s the boat?!
36925,Chandler,"Well, itÂ’s good that you finally have a place to do that."
36931,Chandler,Do you know what I was thinkinÂ’?
36935,Chandler,"Uh why, do you have a lecture?"
36937,Chandler,Then free as a bird. WhatÂ’s up?
36941,Chandler,"Well, did-did you correct him?"
36948,Chandler,"Oh no problem, maybe IÂ’ll play with my left hand."
36950,Chandler,Does anybody know me?!
36956,Chandler,DonÂ’t worry about it Pheebs.
36959,Chandler,An old cookie?
36962,Chandler,We canÂ’t accept this.
36964,Chandler,Â‘Cause itÂ’s gross.
36968,Chandler,"Okay, we owe you a present."
37001,Chandler,I will tell the story! It was going great. I let him win. We were bonding. He even said I could call him dad.
37010,Chandler,Why do they put so much steam in there?!
37012,Chandler,Why? Okay? Why? Wh-wh-why did that have to happen?
37014,Chandler,Not that big a deal? ThereÂ…there was touching of things.
37017,Chandler,I donÂ’t want him to tell this story for years.
37023,Chandler,If that is your father calling to tell this story then the marriage is off!
37119,Chandler,"So you understand, IÂ’d feel a lot more comfortable if you didnÂ’t tell people what happened. YÂ’know, IÂ’m a littleÂ…IÂ’m a little embarrassed about it."
37121,Chandler,What did you do when they found out?
37123,Chandler,So I guess we wear swimsuits in here!
37144,Chandler,ItÂ’s your mommy. ItÂ’s your mommy.
37150,Chandler,That was one of the worse things ever. And not just on TV.
37158,Chandler,And say nothing?
37213,Chandler,"Hi sweetie. So, what was with all the whispering?"
37215,Chandler,Secret? Married people arenÂ’t supposed to have secrets between one another. We have too much love and respect for one another.
37217,Chandler,"No IÂ’m serious, we should tell each other everything. I do not have any secrets from you."
37219,Chandler,"Oh no-no, I canÂ’t do that."
37223,Chandler,"So, Ross and I are going to Disneyland and we stop at this restaurant for tacos. And when I say restaurant, I mean a guy, a hibachi, and the trunk of his car. So Ross has about 10 tacos. And anyway, weÂ’re on Space Mountain and Ross starts to feel a little iffy."
37227,Chandler,ThatÂ’s it?! I gave up my Disneyland story for that?
37232,Chandler,What about him?
37272,Chandler,"Oh itÂ’s always nicer to here than, ""Aw crap! You again!"""
37278,Chandler,Did you not understand the story?
37280,Chandler,Hey! WhatÂ’s up?
37297,Chandler,I had too okay?! WeÂ’re getting married! Married couples canÂ’t keep secrets from one another!
37302,Chandler,"Did you not hear me say, ""Du-ude?!"""
37305,Chandler,"In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy."
37307,Chandler,"Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?"
37319,Chandler,"You wanna tell secrets?! Okay! Okay! In college, Ross used to wear leg warmers!"
37321,Chandler,Ross came in forth and cried!
37334,Chandler,That was you!
37378,Chandler,YÂ’know when I said that because weÂ’re getting married that we should share everything and not have any secrets?
37380,Chandler,Yeah that was stupid. LetÂ’s not do that.
37387,Chandler,"Yeah, and not that you would, but I wouldnÂ’t hang out withÂ…all the guys in my office."
37408,Chandler,Someone on the subway licked my neck! Licked my neck!!
37410,Chandler,What are you guys doing?
37412,Chandler,"Oooh, IÂ’m afraid that does not exist."
37416,Chandler,"I donÂ’t know what it is, I just canÂ’t take a good picture."
37418,Chandler,"Yeah, IÂ’m not in that."
37426,Chandler,How about those three pointers?
37431,Chandler,"Yes, and we call Ross Lingers In The Bathroom."
37438,Chandler,They have that on the napkins at the club.
37442,Chandler,"Rach, if you have a crush on this guy, why would you hire him? I mean yÂ’know you canÂ’t date him right?"
37449,Chandler,Dude that is so sad.
37451,Chandler,Could I play?
37474,Chandler,"No, I am."
37503,Chandler,Oh my God! Those are my bedroom eyes?! Why did you ever sleep with me?
37564,Chandler,I canÂ’t help it!
37566,Chandler,Borrow money from me?
37568,Chandler,Why is there jelly on your shoe?
37582,Chandler,IÂ’m still right here!
37587,Chandler,"Did you have a crush on me, when you first met me?"
37601,Chandler,There I am!
37603,Chandler,"Yeah, Joey said I uh, I needed to relax so he gave me an antihistamine."
37605,Chandler,"Yeah, and then I fell asleep on the subway and went all the way to Brooklyn. Brooklyn is f-far!!"
37680,Chandler,"Oh yeah, that looks good."
37687,Chandler,IÂ’m marrying her.
37712,Chandler,Die Hard still great!
37714,Chandler,WhatÂ’d you rent?
37722,Chandler,"Yeah, I just got uh, got plans."
37724,Chandler,"No, see the thing is I want to get out of here before Joey gets all worked up and starts calling everybody bitch."
37758,Chandler,"So uh, what did this woman look like?"
37760,Chandler,"Well, is there any chance you were looking into a bright, shiny thing called a mirror?"
37766,Chandler,"Julie Grath, my camp girlfriend."
37770,Chandler,"Well, Â‘cause she came back the third summer and sheÂ’d gotten really fa-aa-aw-ow"
37772,Chandler,"I did not say fat! I said, ""Fa-aa-aw-owÂ…"""
37774,Chandler,"Yeah. Yeah, but it was a really, really long time ago! Does she still feel bad?"
37817,Chandler,Can you figure out what IÂ’m doing?
37821,Chandler,Because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom?!
37823,Chandler,What? Are you kidding? That was like 16 years ago.
37825,Chandler,"Okay, I will do it. But I have to warn you; this may make me a better person and that is not the man you feel in love with!"
37866,Chandler,"Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken up with you because you were overweight."
37884,Chandler,As bad as that went I actually enjoyed myself. I think that IÂ’m going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.
37886,Chandler,I would really love it if could do both.
37892,Chandler,A hundred and forty-five pounds.
37894,Chandler,"Look I know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but I was 15!"
37896,Chandler,"Okay. Okay, now wait a minute that was totally different."
37898,Chandler,You were not supposed to hear that! I said that behind you back!
37902,Chandler,So you can balloon up or you can shrink down and I will still love you.
37904,Chandler,IÂ’d carry you around in my pocket.
37906,Chandler,SkidmarkÂ’s still got a way with the ladies.
37954,Chandler,Come on! Why are we here?!
37956,Chandler,The hot chicks?
37958,Chandler,Wow thatÂ’s actually pretty cool.
37960,Chandler,Sounds like two people are really enjoying the Dewey decimal system.
37963,Chandler,"You didnÂ’t bring me here to do that, did you?"
37973,Chandler,"OHÂ…MYÂ…GAWD! I am so sorry sweetie, are you okay? You didnÂ’t tell her we were getting married, did you?"
37975,Chandler,Did she freak out?
37981,Chandler,You said no right?!
37983,Chandler,Lie!!! How hard is that?! The checkÂ’s in the mail! Oh your baby is so cute! I canÂ’t wait to read your book Ross!!
37985,Chandler,What do you think sheÂ’s just gonna sit there quietly? You donÂ’t think sheÂ’s gonna want to make a toast? You donÂ’t think sheÂ’s gonna want to grab the microphone and sing Part-time Lover?!
37987,Chandler,YÂ’know what? ItÂ’s gonna be okay. YÂ’know what? SheÂ’s probably not gonna even want to come.
37989,Chandler,No! That was a lie! See how easy that was?
38082,Chandler,"Well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about the wedding. Um, itÂ’s going to be a small ceremony. Uh, tiny! WeÂ’re not even sure why weÂ’re having it."
38152,Chandler,I say we go with Careless Whisper.
38159,Chandler,ArenÂ’t you just a tinsy bit curious?
38164,Chandler,"No-no-no-no, if we let her stay, she will stay forever!"
38166,Chandler,Is that what youÂ’re thinking about right now?
38169,Chandler,"Janice, IÂ’m sorry but umm, you canÂ’t stay here tonight."
38171,Chandler,"Honestly? Our apartment is a hotbed for electromagnetic activity. Now Monica and I have been immunized, but sadly you have not."
38179,Chandler,"Feelings, such strong feelings."
38185,Chandler,"No, no, no. No-no-no."
38187,Chandler,"No, we're playing this game I learned at work. You have to name all the states in six minutes."
38193,Chandler,"Oh, okay, time's up!"
38195,Chandler,"Oh that's not bad, Pheebs?"
38197,Chandler,"Okay, so Rachel's got 48 and Phoebe has the lead inÂ…vegetables, Joey?"
38219,Chandler,"Look Ross, if you don't know them by now, you will never know them, okay? That is the beauty of this game. It makes you want to kill yourself."
38221,Chandler,"Okay, but if you can'tÂ…no dinner!"
38229,Chandler,"Sure, and Joey; do not let Ross look at any of the maps or the globe in your apartment."
38238,Chandler,I don't know. Maybe it's because it smells a little weird. It's like old pumpkins or something.
38240,Chandler,Which smells delicious!
38248,Chandler,"Tell her, I'm allergic, and I will sue!"
38261,Chandler,Huh! Where is the dog?!
38266,Chandler,"Phoebe, we can hear the dog barking!"
38268,Chandler,What is it doing here?
38271,Chandler,"Extremely allergic, okay? If I'm anywhere near a dog for more than 5 minutes, my throat will just close up!"
38275,Chandler,"Well, it still has to go, right?"
38276,Chandler,"Okay, it's um"
38285,Chandler,"They are needy, they are jumpy, and you can't tell what they are thinking, and that scares me a little bit."
38294,Chandler,"Okay, it's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable."
38375,Chandler,"Well, I, I should go in there."
38382,Chandler,"Monica's all upset, because I sent Clunkers away."
38384,Chandler,"Yeah, I can be a hero, I could do that. I could, I could do... I, w-w-what if, what if it attacks me?"
38395,Chandler,"No, no he went for a walk."
38402,Chandler,"Please, please, please, don't be mad at me."
38408,Chandler,Clunkers?! Oh my god!
38414,Chandler,It's up to you.
38457,Chandler,Hey! What are you guys doing?
38460,Chandler,"IÂ’m sorry, who?"
38462,Chandler,But we donÂ’t know the neighbors.
38465,Chandler,WouldnÂ’t it be easier if we just moved?
38467,Chandler,"Eh, somebodyÂ’s in a good mood!"
38539,Chandler,"Hey, you cry every time somebody talks about Titanic!"
38547,Chandler,Hey! So are you enjoying the bike?
38556,Chandler,"Absolutely! YÂ’know, because touchie can mean both ass and good worker."
38562,Chandler,What is the matter with you?
38573,Chandler,"Maybe, isnÂ’t she the woman who lives below you and has sex really loud?"
38578,Chandler,YÂ’know what would work?
38580,Chandler,Stop making candy!
38582,Chandler,You mean they like you.
38584,Chandler,Is that why you became a chef? So that people would like you?
38670,Chandler,What are you doing?
38679,Chandler,"All right, yÂ’know what? Forget it, all of you forget it! YouÂ’ve ruined it! Go home! YouÂ’ve ruined it! YouÂ’ve ruined it!"
38684,Chandler,No! Smokes-A-Lot Lady blew smoke directly into my mouth. Eh-uhÂ—are you okay?
38715,Chandler,How long have we been home?
38718,Chandler,"Hey, you know what I was thinking? When we get married, are you gonna change your last name to Bing?"
38728,Chandler,Ohh! You guys gonna be living together again?
38730,Chandler,"Well, she's just so much fun with Joey, I just assumed, she'd still be living with him."
38732,Chandler,"No reason, exceptÂ…sheÂ…toldÂ…me."
38734,Chandler,"No! No, she didn't say that. I-I-I think you should talk to Monica now."
38739,Chandler,"Bing doesn't seem so weird now, does it?"
38747,Chandler,Forty-five minutes? We have tickets to the Musicman at 8:00.
38749,Chandler,Is this because of the burrito thing?
38751,Chandler,Give him money? It was a joke!
38753,Chandler,"Right, calm down, O'Mally. I'll slip him some money."
38782,Chandler,How do you know so much about this?
38784,Chandler,"Richard used to do it, didn't he?"
38802,Chandler,"If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a vile of small pox to release in the hallway?"
38864,Chandler,"Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weirdÂ…turtle-man?"
38871,Chandler,"You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!"
38875,Chandler,But I didn't get to shape my belly like a bowl full of jelly.
38877,Chandler,"Fine, I'll give the suit back."
38881,Chandler,Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?
38889,Chandler,"Well, I'll stay, but only because I wanna hear about Hanukkah. Ben, will you sit here with Santa and learn about Hanukkah?"
38940,Chandler,"Hey, you have got to try this cheesecake."
38944,Chandler,IÂ—no! I didn't read the box before I opened it. And you can't return a box after you've opened the box.
38946,Chandler,Because it's too delicious.
38956,Chandler,"Oh, whatÂ’s at 8:00?"
38966,Chandler,"Well, maybe since the age of 9, FrannieÂ’s made some new friends."
38991,Chandler,Another cheesecake came! They delivered it to the wrong address again!
38993,Chandler,I canÂ’t seem to say goodbye.
38995,Chandler,Well IÂ’ve forgotten what it tastes like okay?!
38999,Chandler,Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch?
39025,Chandler,"Well, thank you for lunch."
39031,Chandler,"By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We donÂ’t want her to come back to bad cheesecake."
39033,Chandler,"Well, we donÂ’t want that."
39035,Chandler,But we should take it.
39075,Chandler,"IÂ’m full, and yet I know if I stop eating this, IÂ’ll regret it."
39080,Chandler,What are you doing tonight?
39084,Chandler,"Oh really? Uh, Monica said she had a date at 9:00."
39086,Chandler,ThatÂ’s what Monica said.
39142,Chandler,Are you eating the cheesecake without me?!
39152,Chandler,Oh yes! Oh yes!
39154,Chandler,"Well thatÂ’s not fair, youÂ’ve already had some!"
39156,Chandler,What do we use to split it?
39198,Chandler,Stick to your side!
39249,Chandler,"I know, just quick-quick question, quick question. Which one was Deep Impact and which one was Armageddon?"
39265,Chandler,It got interesting! Damn you Oprah!
39267,Chandler,"Hey, yÂ’know what we can do? YÂ’know, now that we are up? We can just like talk to each other all night long, yÂ’know like we did when we were first going out. ItÂ’d be fun!"
39269,Chandler,"Okay, so how bummed were you when the second sister died huh?"
39332,Chandler,Do you know what just happened?
39334,Chandler,No. We were in the middle of sexÂ…and you fell asleep.
39338,Chandler,"I was giving you some of my best moves, and you missed it. So please wake up so we can do it right!"
39398,Chandler,"Well, youÂ’re not gonna believe this, but if you have seven minutes"
39400,Chandler,Do you wanna?
39422,Chandler,"CouldnÂ’t I just say, ""This is Ross?"""
39615,Chandler,"Yeah, IÂ’d love to but IÂ’ve tried that so many times they wonÂ’t even let me in the store anymore."
39619,Chandler,ThatÂ’s awesome! ThatÂ’s great! What made you do it?!
39621,Chandler,Whoa-whoa-whoa! You broke JoeyÂ’s chair?
39623,Chandler,I thought I broke JoeyÂ’s chair! ThatÂ’s why I replaced it with mine!
39625,Chandler,"Well, what did you think, that-that elves came in and fixed it?"
39630,Chandler,Joey you broke my chair!!
39637,Chandler,I think I should get the chair!
39641,Chandler,"Well, whereÂ’s the logic in that?!"
39643,Chandler,So Joey breaks my chair and I get nothing!
39645,Chandler,What are you guys? Like a gang or something?!
39727,Chandler,"No Rach, itÂ’s not just you. My thirtieth birthday certainly wasnÂ’t that much fun."
39742,Chandler,"Ross, a sports car? WouldnÂ’t it have been cheaper to just stuff a sock down there?"
39773,Chandler,Hey-hey are you drunk?
39775,Chandler,"Okay, here is the thing. We have thrown a very formal surprise party for you in there! All of your friends are in there and your parents!"
39781,Chandler,"Okay, hereÂ’s the thing. WeÂ’re gonna get you some coffee and they will never know that youÂ’re drunk."
39783,Chandler,"Yeah, IÂ’ll take care of it."
39787,Chandler,"ThatÂ’s still yours. Okay, now remember itÂ’s a surprise party. So, when you go in, act surprised."
39824,Chandler,"Okay before we start the celebration, Monica has to go put on her party dress."
39834,Chandler,MonicaÂ’s a little drunk.
39851,Chandler,"Okay, open ours next. Open ours next!"
39856,Chandler,No-no-no-no! That was the joke!
39858,Chandler,"No, because youÂ’re not a grandmother!"
39917,Chandler,"Okay, here we go."
39944,Chandler,Hey! HowÂ’d it go?
39948,Chandler,"Well, here we are, just a bunch of thirty year olds."
39966,Chandler,Do you think you could get through a poem?
39984,Chandler,So great things are happening at work and in your personal life!
40000,Chandler,DonÂ’t do it.
40071,Chandler,I think itÂ’s the dying cat parade.
40075,Chandler,"YÂ’know that thing that Ross was gonna do at our wedding?! He was hanging out with me yesterday and he turned to me and said, ""YouÂ’re half Scottish right?"""
40079,Chandler,Why is your family Ross?!
40081,Chandler,"If you listen very carefully, I think its Celebration by Cool and the Gang."
40133,Chandler,"Well, I feel like a snack!"
40135,Chandler,Oh no thanks. I donÂ’t like any thing from my Scottish heritage.
40143,Chandler,We heard you play all the way from your apartment!
40145,Chandler,"ThatÂ’s not really important right now. What is important is; while we appreciate the gesture, we just donÂ’t feel bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding."
40147,Chandler,Because we hate them.
40149,Chandler,We have heard you play.
40313,Chandler,You mean the spitter?
40315,Chandler,Easy for you to say; youÂ’ll be wearing a veil.
40317,Chandler,You mean the guy who kept staring at your chest?
40319,Chandler,"Sorry, I just donÂ’t like the idea of when I say, ""I do,"" heÂ’s thinking, ""Yeah, IÂ’d do her too!"""
40331,Chandler,Guys thank you very much but neither of you is marrying us.
40333,Chandler,"We are going to have a legitimate member of the clergy! And when I say legitimate I mean, gay and in control of his saliva!"
40352,Chandler,"No, but Horny for Monica Minister called, wanting to know if we were still together."
40364,Chandler,Yeah you can do it.
40448,Chandler,"See Joe, not that thatÂ’s not grrreat! But, one of the cool things about having somebody we know perform the ceremony is that it can be about us! YÂ’know, it can be more personal. You can tell stories about us!"
40455,Chandler,"See Joe, we want you to tell stories but yÂ’know, romantic stories. Nice stories."
40461,Chandler,IsnÂ’t that what happened with you and the brideÂ’s maid?
40467,Chandler,And I was a perfect gentleman and I walked her to her hotel room and said goodnight.
40469,Chandler,But then later that night
40475,Chandler,"Well, last time I saw him he was heading out the door with the brideÂ’s maid and a bucket of strawberries. So uh, youÂ’re not still upset about what that guy told ya are ya?"
40477,Chandler,"Well, look itÂ’s been a really emotional time yÂ’know, and youÂ’ve had a lot to drink. And youÂ’ve just got to let that go okay? I mean you were the most beautiful in the room tonight!"
40481,Chandler,But we donÂ’t do that.
40483,Chandler,How drunk are you?
40496,Chandler,It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.
40500,Chandler,Count of three?
40504,Chandler,Well I think itÂ’s safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.
40511,Chandler,No! No! No!
40515,Chandler,"Uh, could you leave me one?"
40519,Chandler,No I-I-IÂ’m fine.
40528,Chandler,Who did you originally want to hook up with?
40536,Chandler,I donÂ’t believe it. The most romantic night of my life and IÂ’m runner up.
40541,Chandler,"Okay, itÂ’s just weird! Okay? I donÂ’t want to be standing their saying my vows and then having the mental image of you and Monica! I-I-I needÂ…I donÂ’t know what I need. I need a walk."
40583,Chandler,"Look Joe, I know you wanted to do the wedding"
40585,Chandler,How can I not be upset? Okay? I finally fall in love with this fantastic woman and it turns out that she wanted you first!
40587,Chandler,ThatÂ’s what you should say.
40589,Chandler,When youÂ’re marrying us; thatÂ’s what you should say.
40591,Chandler,IÂ’d love it if you would do it.
40593,Chandler,But those are the words! Those exact words!
40615,Chandler,"Yeah, we talked and Monica made me see that I over reacted a little bit and some things in life are more important."
40633,Chandler,So did Monica tell you about this great band called the Swing Kings that weÂ’re trying to get to play at the wedding?
40635,Chandler,Oh since forever! I used to go all over town listening to bands!
40639,Chandler,Do you want me to call?
40642,Chandler,Staying out of the way.
40649,Chandler,Sure! ThatÂ’s one of the great things about being engaged. IÂ’m not nervous talking to pretty girls anymore.
40746,Chandler,"So Ross, how was your date the other night? Did you tell her about the magical ride that starts with the flush of every toilet?"
40753,Chandler,"Uh Joe, when itÂ’s one oÂ’clock in the morning and you donÂ’t come by? ThatÂ’s okay!"
40755,Chandler,Really? Right across the street?
40757,Chandler,WhenÂ’d you meet her?
40759,Chandler,Excellent! YÂ’know Ross met somebody too!
40762,Chandler,Hi! HowÂ’d it go?
40828,Chandler,But I love swing music!
40830,Chandler,"Look all I know is when Monica and I went to see them, we had fun! And thereÂ’s another reason too."
40832,Chandler,I donÂ’t want to say.
40834,Chandler,Well itÂ’s just while Monica and I were dancing to them it wasÂ…the first time I knew thatÂ…you were the woman I wanted to dance all my dances with.
40877,Chandler,"Hi, honey! IÂ’m home!"
40879,Chandler,Why? Do you another boyfriend in there or something?
40881,Chandler,"YÂ’know itÂ’s funny I started it but, now itÂ’s scary me. So could you come out here please?"
40883,Chandler,Oh you got a wedding dress? ThatÂ’s great!
40885,Chandler,Well then why canÂ’t I see it?
40889,Chandler,"Yeah, thatÂ’s like the most ugliest dress IÂ’ve ever seen. Wh-why do you to return it?"
40891,Chandler,Oh thatÂ’s great! Great! Thanks! But that dress I mean itÂ’s like yuck! ItÂ’s terrible! It makes me wanna just rip it right off of you!
41086,Chandler,"Okay. Well, I think the centerpieces are too big"
41088,Chandler,Kinda. TheyÂ’re really big.
41092,Chandler,"No. No, see when I first meet somebody itÂ’s uh itÂ’s mostly panic, anxiety, and a great deal of sweating."
41094,Chandler,"Sleeping with somebody new, anxiety, panic, and IÂ’m afraid even more sweating."
41098,Chandler,"Well yeah! But now that I know that youÂ’re having these thoughts, IÂ’m back to panic, anxiety, and uh IÂ’m definitely gonna need some kind of sports drink."
41192,Chandler,YÂ’know IÂ’m-IÂ’m really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding.
41194,Chandler,YÂ’know I was thinking if we had aÂ…a big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours
41196,Chandler,"Technically we could have sex again. What do you think, bossy and domineering?!"
41198,Chandler,ThatÂ’s me! Come on!
41200,Chandler,"Well get rid of her, obsessive and shrill."
41208,Chandler,IÂ’ll be right with you.
41217,Chandler,"Umm, so this Aunt Marilyn is-is-is-is she coming to the wedding?"
41414,Chandler,"This is so sad. I mean, I only have like ten pins."
41430,Chandler,YÂ’know I think we should invite them.
41432,Chandler,Well this is just sad!
41438,Chandler,"Well, thanks a lot for hookinÂ’ me up Rach. I want you to know that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest."
41442,Chandler,You mean like for award shows?
41444,Chandler,"You mean these tuxes have been down the red carpet with people yelling, ""You are you wearing?! You look fabulous!"""
41454,Chandler,Are you serious?
41456,Chandler,007?! This is James BondÂ’s tux?!
41458,Chandler,"Oh, I have to get married in James BondÂ’s tux!"
41503,Chandler,A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?
41507,Chandler,You canÂ’t wear that! IÂ’m wearing the famous tux! James BondÂ’s tux!
41509,Chandler,SoÂ—If you wear that youÂ’ll make mine less special.
41511,Chandler,"Please, donÂ’t take away my cool thing. Please?! Pretty please?!"
41513,Chandler,"Look, itÂ’s my wedding day okay? If you were getting married I would never do anything to upset you."
41515,Chandler,That was pretty 007.
41544,Chandler,Ross is Batman!
41546,Chandler,Rachel got Ross the tuxedo that Val Kilmer wore in Batman. Okay Batman is so much cooler than James Bond!
41548,Chandler,Batman has a utility belt!
41550,Chandler,Batman has the Batmobile!
41554,Chandler,"Actually, I donÂ’t like martinis."
41584,Chandler,I would but mine doesnÂ’t fit. The pants are a little tight.
41587,Chandler,"Well, does that mean that youÂ’re not going to wearing yours?"
41593,Chandler,An invitation for the At First Sight premiere? Oh my God! Val Kilmer didnÂ’t wear this in Batman! He wore it to the premiere of some tooty-fruity love story where he played a blind guy!
41600,Chandler,"Well, youÂ’re welcome. And tell them weÂ’re really glad theyÂ’re coming."
41621,Chandler,Whose is it?
41623,Chandler,Whose is it?
41625,Chandler,"Oh, come on! I donÂ’t care! Come on! Whose is it?"
41628,Chandler,Do you realize you get louder each week?
41632,Chandler,"Right. So uh, have you written yours yet?"
41634,Chandler,Do you happen to know what IÂ’m going to say?
41640,Chandler,"IÂ’m so pathetic! Monica knows what she wants to say! You shouldÂ’ve seen her. Writing, writing, writing!"
41651,Chandler,"Yeah, IÂ’m not sure I can do that."
41656,Chandler,"All right, thereÂ’s a nuclear holocaust, IÂ’m the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?"
41663,Chandler,"Oh, yÂ’know-yÂ’know what, I was looking at it upside down."
41673,Chandler,You'll get one.
41675,Chandler,"All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?"
41677,Chandler,"Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically."
41679,Chandler,"No, no, no."
41688,Chandler,This is not going to work.
41690,Chandler,You are so great! I love you!
41692,Chandler,"Nothing! I said, I said ""You're so great"" and then I just, I just stopped talking!"
41694,Chandler,No I didn't!
41696,Chandler,No I didn't!
41698,Chandler,No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
41699,Chandler,"YÂ’know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?"
41701,Chandler,"Well, what if all my stuff was here?"
41703,Chandler,Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what IÂ’m saying?
41705,Chandler,Oh my God.
41728,Chandler,"I've had a very long, hard day."
41730,Chandler,"Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then."
41732,Chandler,"Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me about chicken."
41741,Chandler,It happened in London.
41743,Chandler,The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.
41745,Chandler,No-no-no-no-no! You can't!
41779,Chandler,"Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?"
41781,Chandler,Phoebe knows about us!
41788,Chandler,"Ahh yes, the messers become the messies!"
41799,Chandler,"Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put lotion on her!"
41813,Chandler,"Oh, you're-you're going?"
41817,Chandler,Not if I kiss you first.
41819,Chandler,"Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss."
41821,Chandler,Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have sex with ya!
41823,Chandler,Because I'm in love with Monica!!
41830,Chandler,"Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet."
41843,Chandler,Who are those people?
41854,Chandler,WhatÂ’s going on?
41858,Chandler,So we both finished our vows.
41871,Chandler,"DonÂ’t worry honey, weÂ’ll make yours funnier."
41872,Chandler,"Okay, what do you guys think?"
41875,Chandler,You really like it?
41877,Chandler,I stole MonicaÂ’s and changed the name.
41915,Chandler,"Oh! Right. Umm, maybe thatÂ’s because I didnÂ’t send him an invitation."
41917,Chandler,I donÂ’t even know the man. Okay? WeÂ’re not the close. I havenÂ’t seen him in years.
41919,Chandler,"Well he doesnÂ’t have to know! ItÂ’s not like we run in the same circles. I hang out with you guys, and he stars in a drag show in Vegas."
41921,Chandler,"Trust me, you donÂ’t want him there either. Okay? Nobody is gonna be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back-less dress."
41961,Chandler,YÂ’know we already went over this and I won!
41963,Chandler,Look forget it okay? I donÂ’t want to go. I donÂ’t want to see him. I donÂ’t wanna.
41965,Chandler,"No-no all kids are embarrassed by their parents, youÂ’d have to come up with a whole new word for what I went through. When I was in High School, he used to come to all of my swim meets dressed as a different Hollywood starlet. YÂ’know itÂ’s hard enough to be fourteen. YouÂ’re skinny. YouÂ’re wearing speedoesÂ—That your mom promised that you would grow into! And you look up into the stands and thereÂ’s your dad cheering you on dressed as Carmen Miranda. We was wearing a headdress with real fruit that he will later hand out to your friends as a healthy snack!"
41967,Chandler,He had sex with Mr. Girabaldi!
41969,Chandler,Does it matter?!
41971,Chandler,"Yeah o-okay, but IÂ’m just doing this for you."
41973,Chandler,So I really never get to win anymore?
42011,Chandler,No! No! I donÂ’t want him to know weÂ’re yet! IÂ’m not sure IÂ’m ready for that. And besides heÂ’s not gonna be too happy to see me either.
42013,Chandler,"I donÂ’t know if IÂ’ve told you this, but heÂ’s kinda tried to get in contact with me a lot over the last few years"
42017,Chandler,And thereÂ’s daddy!
42064,Chandler,"Believe me, IÂ’ve been saying that for years. Oh my God!"
42066,Chandler,ThatÂ’s Mr. Girabaldi playing the piano.
42068,Chandler,HeÂ’s coming into the audience. HeÂ’s coming into the audience.
42075,Chandler,It canÂ’t happen like this. Okay? IÂ’ll meet you back at the hotel.
42097,Chandler,"Oh, theyÂ’re a hoot."
42103,Chandler,Actually Monica and I are engaged.
42107,Chandler,Wait! Wait! WeÂ’d really love it if you could be there.
42109,Chandler,"I know it would make me happy, maÂ’am."
42112,Chandler,Yeah. Thanks for making me do this.
42153,Chandler,Yep! From now on its gonna be the four of you guys and me and the misses. The little woman. The wife. The old ball and chain.
42155,Chandler,The young hot ball and chain.
42165,Chandler,"Listen, if you want to borrow money, its kind of a bad time. IÂ’m buying dinner for 128 people tomorrow night."
42167,Chandler,But youÂ’re still my friend?
42169,Chandler,"During this timeÂ…are you, are you still my best man?"
42171,Chandler,Do I still call you Ross?
42175,Chandler,So are weÂ…friends again?
42236,Chandler,"Yes, include more people in this."
42238,Chandler,Wait a minute! I have a date tomorrow night.
42240,Chandler,Well you donÂ’t have to sound so surprised.
42244,Chandler,Honestly? Me too.
42246,Chandler,Yeah. YÂ’know I keep thinking that something stupid is gonna come up and IÂ’ll go allÂ…Chandler. But nothing has.
42248,Chandler,Okay. IÂ’ll be right there.
42251,Chandler,WeÂ’re the Bings.
42471,Chandler,How did you guys find me? I knew I shouldÂ’ve hid at the gym!
42473,Chandler,Panicking! And using the Internet to try to prove that IÂ’m related to Monica. How is she?
42475,Chandler,No! No! No! I canÂ’t do that!
42477,Chandler,"Because if I go home, weÂ’re gonna become the Bings! I canÂ’t be the Bings!"
42479,Chandler,The Bings have horrible marriages! They yell. They fight. And they use the pool boy as a pawn in their sexual games!
42483,Chandler,"ItÂ’s not just their marriage! I mean, look at yours. Look at everybodyÂ’s! The only person that can make marriage work is Paul Newman! And IÂ’ve met me; I am not Paul Newman. I donÂ’t race cars! I donÂ’t make popcorn! None of my proceeds go to charity."
42485,Chandler,"I want to. I love her so much, but IÂ’m afrÂ…ItÂ’s too huge."
42487,Chandler,"Well yeah, but then"
42489,Chandler,Depends on what you mean by we.
42541,Chandler,"Yeah okay. Well, whatÂ’s the next little bit?"
42543,Chandler,Yeah. YouÂ’re right. Hey I-I can do that.
42547,Chandler,"Ross, I am not gonna run away again! I just want to get a little fresh air."
42550,Chandler,Oh fresh air!
42602,Chandler,I know about Monica.
42605,Chandler,"Yeah, I heard you and Rachel talking."
42607,Chandler,You donÂ’t know?
42612,Chandler,Well I was! Then I went down to the gift shop because I was out of cigarettes
42615,Chandler,"But come on, look at how cute and small this is! So I got it to give Monica so sheÂ’d know I was okay."
42622,Chandler,Are you Joey?
42655,Chandler,Phoebe found your pregnancy test in the trash.
42657,Chandler,ThenÂ…who did?
42796,Chandler,What are you guys doing?
42827,Chandler,Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!!
42868,Chandler,What?! What are you talking about?
42872,Chandler,WhoÂ’s the father?
42881,Chandler,As in Barbara StreisandÂ’s husband James Brolin?
42885,Chandler,YÂ’know I am the groom right? I was told it was kinda big deal.
42902,Chandler,Before we go out there IÂ’ve got a present for ya.
42906,Chandler,IÂ’ve been taking dancing lessons.
42908,Chandler,"Yeah, the last six weeks. I wanted this to be a moment you will never forget."
42910,Chandler,So? Would you care to join me in our first dance as husband and wife?
42913,Chandler,"I donÂ’t know, itÂ’s these new shoes, theyÂ’re all slippery."
42951,Chandler,Bravo Dennis thanks for pleasing my mother so.
42966,Chandler,What size shoes do you wear?
42968,Chandler,"Great, because my shoes are giving me a little problem on the dance floor, can I borrow the boots from your costume?"
43036,Chandler,And the world will never know.
43038,Chandler,"Yes, I told him how talented you were. I told him all about Days Of Our Lives."
43040,Chandler,But youÂ’re not just a soap actor. You are a soap actor with freakishly tiny feet.
43080,Chandler,Did it turn into sand?
43136,Chandler,We got the honeymoon.
43138,Chandler,The wedding pictures?
43140,Chandler,Not the disposable cameras from the tables.
43142,Chandler,"IÂ’ll tell you what, I will go get them developed and you can go home."
43144,Chandler,What? What did you take a picture of?
43146,Chandler,"Okay Ross has the cameras, has he checked out yet?"
43160,Chandler,Score! Where are the disposable cameras?
43162,Chandler,The cameras? Remember last night I told you to take them?
43164,Chandler,"Yes! Remember? Right before we cut the cake, I went up to you and I said"
43166,Chandler,So you donÂ’t have the cameras?!
43168,Chandler,So? What? What? TheyÂ’re gone! MonicaÂ’s gonna freak!
43221,Chandler,Hey! Did you find the cameras?
43223,Chandler,Yes! And thatÂ’s why IÂ’m under the table. Celebrating.
43225,Chandler,"Well this is great. YÂ’know, those cameras were the only thing that was gonna cheer Monica up today, sheÂ’s really depressed."
43227,Chandler,All my energy is going into not asking that question. I canÂ’t believe I screwed this up!
43229,Chandler,Are you suggesting we dance our troubles away?
43231,Chandler,Are you serious?
43233,Chandler,Marriage advice? Really?!
43235,Chandler,"I donÂ’t know, Monica picked out the flowers."
43237,Chandler,She picked those out too.
43239,Chandler,That was her.
43241,Chandler,I was in charge of the cameras! Gift shop?
43298,Chandler,Who are you? Ansel Adams?! Get outta here!
43309,Chandler,Why donÂ’t you go up on stage. IÂ’ll get a picture of you doing the speech.
43320,Chandler,"Okay, you ready for the last picture?"
43370,Chandler,ItÂ’s picture time.
43381,Chandler,Call it even?!
43398,Chandler,Hey! Babe! ArenÂ’t you excited weÂ’re going on our honeymoon?
43404,Chandler,IÂ’d better go pack.
43436,Chandler,"Oh no-no Joey, I am not going to tell you because I am an excellent secret keeper."
43438,Chandler,You already know.
43480,Chandler,"Oh honey, leave them alone, theyÂ’re in love."
43487,Chandler,We are on our honeymoon.
43495,Chandler,"25J and K, any chance those arenÂ’t together?"
43507,Chandler,Just act like you belong.
43513,Chandler,"Oh thatÂ’s all right, I have it memorized. ItÂ’s 1A."
43586,Chandler,Oh youÂ’ve got to be kidding me.
43591,Chandler,WeÂ’re you just ten seconds later!
43597,Chandler,What else is new?
43674,Chandler,"Wait. Before we go in, I just want you to know I love you. I had a great time on our honeymoon, and I canÂ’t wait to go in there and spend the rest of our life together."
43684,Chandler,"TheyÂ’re terrific, and they live right here in the city."
43686,Chandler,"IÂ’m sorry, weÂ’re just kinda excited because we finally have a couple to hang out with."
43691,Chandler,"Listen, they are really great. If you just got a chance"
43693,Chandler,We reallyÂ…didnÂ’t get a chance to
43706,Chandler,Ross! ItÂ’s got your wavy black lines!
43733,Chandler,YÂ’know who has a great video camera?
43736,Chandler,LetÂ’s call Â‘em.
43750,Chandler,"I donÂ’t know! You were a delight to talk to. You asked all those insightful, great questions."
43832,Chandler,"I still donÂ’t get it, we didnÂ’t do anything wrong."
43834,Chandler,I thought you said those jokes were funny. Joke! Joke! Joke!
43836,Chandler,Well maybe it was all of your questions.
43838,Chandler,"The sheer volume, it was like flying with the Riddler!"
43874,Chandler,Did you do it on our invitations?!
43895,Chandler,ThatÂ’s the magic story you use when you wanna have sex!
43939,Chandler,Jenny! That is so Jenny!
43968,Chandler,"You know me sir. Oh ah, I do have a question for ya. Do you know how I get around the office computer network so I can access the really good Internet porn?"
43970,Chandler,WhatÂ’s funny about that?
43972,Chandler,"Hey thatÂ’s okay. So, where do you want to go?"
43974,Chandler,The Hard Rock Caf?
43982,Chandler,"Yeah, he thinks thatÂ’s my name."
43984,Chandler,"Oh itÂ’s been going on way to long now. YÂ’know, I mean the first time he said it we were just passing each other in the hallway, so I didnÂ’t say anything. And then the next time he said, ""Hey Toby, do you want a donut?"" And I-I wanted a donut. And now itÂ’s five years later, the donutÂ’s gone and IÂ’m still Toby."
43988,Chandler,Shh! It is a family name!
44047,Chandler,"If I see him, IÂ’ll ask."
44052,Chandler,WeÂ’re on a semi-first name basis.
44054,Chandler,"Bob? Ooh, working here with us? Everyday? Yeah, I donÂ’t know if he has what it takes."
44056,Chandler,But this is eleven. ItÂ’s almost twice as hard up here.
44058,Chandler,I think itÂ’s best sir.
44060,Chandler,"YÂ’know what you should do, just toss Â‘em in the shedder and claim you never got Â‘em."
44062,Chandler,What does a guy have to do to be taken seriously around here?!
44085,Chandler,"Sure, whatÂ’s up?"
44167,Chandler,"Okay Bob listen uhh, IÂ’m the reason you didnÂ’t get the job up here."
44171,Chandler,Well that puts me in a difficult position.
44253,Chandler,YouÂ’re an actor!
44299,Chandler,The Velveteen Rabbit was brown and white!
44301,Chandler,No bunny at all!! Always no bunny at all!!!
44305,Chandler,How is that me?
44308,Chandler,When have I ever done that?!
44325,Chandler,Wow! I donÂ’t have the worst costume anymore!
44389,Chandler,JoeyÂ’s gonna be thrilled! He was hoping youÂ’d come by as a slutty nurse.
44391,Chandler,"YouÂ’d think that would embarrass me, but you see IÂ’m maxed out."
44419,Chandler,"Oh relax man, relax. YouÂ’re looking a little flushed."
44423,Chandler,ThereÂ’s no question.
44427,Chandler,I cannot believe you didnÂ’t pick me.
44485,Chandler,Nope! I can do this all day.
44487,Chandler,"God, IÂ’m exhausted."
44489,Chandler,No way! If anything youÂ’ve gotta let me win! My wife thinks IÂ’m a wimp!
44526,Chandler,"Listen, IÂ’ve got a secret for ya. I let him win."
44528,Chandler,"No, I let him winÂ—Ross!"
44530,Chandler,Would you tell her I let you win please?
44534,Chandler,Oh whatÂ’s the matter? Are you scared?
44540,Chandler,"YÂ’know uh, I didnÂ’t actually do this."
44542,Chandler,"No, it wasnÂ’t you."
44544,Chandler,I got a maid. Yay!
44546,Chandler,"Uh honey, I know you donÂ’t like to relinquish control"
44548,Chandler,"Look, sheÂ’s really nice. Okay? And she mentioned that she adored the way that you arranged the sponges."
44550,Chandler,"Yes, I distinctly remember Â‘cause I thought it was a joke. Now just give her a chance, okay?"
44552,Chandler,WhatÂ’s the matter?
44615,Chandler,See? I told you.
44619,Chandler,So she stole your pants and then she came back and wore them in front of you?
44621,Chandler,She mustÂ’ve been planning this for years!
44623,Chandler,"Honey, isnÂ’t it possible that the company that sold the jeans made more than just the one pair?"
44625,Chandler,"So, shouldnÂ’t we go give her the benefit of the doubt before we goÂ…snooping around her crotch?"
44627,Chandler,"Out of curiosity, what is your secret ingredient?"
44705,Chandler,To see her pants?
44707,Chandler,Are you sure? Did you see the stain?
44709,Chandler,"God! She is not stealing from us! Okay, will you let this go?"
44711,Chandler,Oh dear God!
44713,Chandler,And yet you donÂ’t recognize that youÂ’re crazy.
44715,Chandler,HereÂ’s another planÂ…No!
44719,Chandler,I fear a jury will see it the same way!
44721,Chandler,You see that?
44723,Chandler,All right. Yes. Okay. I get your point. But if itÂ’s not your bra will you just let the woman clean the apartment?!
44725,Chandler,You need new clothes.
44755,Chandler,IÂ’m leaning. This is where I lean.
44757,Chandler,Brenda a bee!
44759,Chandler,Yes! ItÂ’s flown into your blouse and youÂ’d better undo your buttons lest it sting you!
44825,Chandler,You had a bachelorette party?!
44827,Chandler,"I thought we werenÂ’t gonna have bachelor/bachelorette parties! YÂ’know, we agreed that it was a silly tradition."
44832,Chandler,You went home with the waitress.
44834,Chandler,I canÂ’t believe you didnÂ’t tell me! You know that the two pillars of marriage are openness and honesty!
44877,Chandler,My God! You must be good in bed!
44882,Chandler,SheÂ’s okay with Rachel and the baby?
44884,Chandler,"Well, you have to honest with her! Otherwise you may think that youÂ’re going down the same path, but youÂ’re really going down different ones."
44889,Chandler,Honey! ThatÂ’s crazy! I donÂ’t want you to get me a stripper
44892,Chandler,"Look, I appreciate it, but uh, itÂ’s a little creepy. YÂ’know? IÂ’m not a bachelor anymore."
44896,Chandler,All right fine! But IÂ’m only doing this for you!
44900,Chandler,"Ah, no-no-no just Ross. Ross and Joey is embarrassing enough."
44902,Chandler,I understand: who would cancel an actual date to go to a fake bachelor party?
44921,Chandler,What are you doing?
44923,Chandler,Okay. I canÂ’t believe tomorrowÂ’s the big day.
44925,Chandler,"YouÂ’re right, this is more fun."
44934,Chandler,"Yeah, yeah right over there."
44936,Chandler,That was weird.
44939,Chandler,So sheÂ’s a
44965,Chandler,I canÂ’t believe there is a naked hooker in there!
44970,Chandler,"That is funny, maybe for my birthday sheÂ’ll murder someone."
44973,Chandler,"Oh actually, IÂ’d rather youÂ…Yeah, go ahead. WeÂ’re gonna have to burn that room down anyway."
44992,Chandler,Why would she do that?
44994,Chandler,This is the worst bachelor party ever!
45001,Chandler,Which is why you should do it.
45003,Chandler,You do it!
45007,Chandler,I donÂ’t think weÂ’ve actually done this before!
45009,Chandler,Well weÂ…we still hang out.
45011,Chandler,"Well yÂ’know, things are different. IÂ’mÂ…IÂ’m married now."
45013,Chandler,"Yeah, I miss that too. I tell you what; from now on weÂ’ll make time to hang out with each other."
45051,Chandler,"Her ass print is still on your grandmotherÂ’s quilt, do you really want to talk about smoking?"
45057,Chandler,Could you not narrate?
45110,Chandler,I have no idea.
45112,Chandler,Yeah! IÂ’m just pretending to watch the game so I donÂ’t have to help out with stuff.
45114,Chandler,Nope! Every once and a while I just scream stuff at the TV.
45131,Chandler,"Oh hey. IÂ’d shake your hand but uh; IÂ’m really into the game. Plus, I think itÂ’d be better for my ego if we didnÂ’t stand right next to each other."
45137,Chandler,"IÂ’m watching the game, but IÂ’m not deaf!"
45148,Chandler,Oh come on!
45190,Chandler,Yeah. Solid effort. Solid effort.
45264,Chandler,Everybody at my school heard it! You were the hermaphrodite cheerleader from Long Island?!
45293,Chandler,IÂ’m sorry. When you were in high school you made out with a 50-year-old woman?
45295,Chandler,Did she look 16?
45299,Chandler,"Well, she probably wasnÂ’t familiar with the process having spent most of her life sitting for oil paintings!"
45329,Chandler,"Yes, I believe we can expect a call from the President any moment now."
45340,Chandler,Oh my God!
45342,Chandler,IÂ’m gonna miss being able to afford food.
45349,Chandler,"Yeah well, too bad weÂ’re gonna have to return them."
45352,Chandler,I have you.
45442,Chandler,"Now sweetie, I know you donÂ’t like my office parties, but you can wear your new boots. See? Every cloud has aÂ…supple leather lining."
45446,Chandler,Do you think I work at some kind of boot pricing company?
45448,Chandler,"You said that you paid all that money because those boots go with skirts, dresses, and pants!"
45496,Chandler,"YÂ’know, that party wasnÂ’t bad."
45498,Chandler,"I donÂ’t see any uh, cabs. Maybe we should just walk?"
45500,Chandler,"What honey, itÂ’s like fifteen blocks to the subway. LetÂ’s go."
45502,Chandler,WhatÂ’s going on?
45510,Chandler,"Honey, I know youÂ’re in pain right now, but IÂ’m a little turned on."
45558,Chandler,"Okay, ten blocks down. Five to go."
45560,Chandler,Oh IÂ’m sorry! Do you need a break?
45562,Chandler,I can see it from right here. ItÂ’ll cost you one husband.
45566,Chandler,"Well, why donÂ’t you check in one of my saddlebags while I chew on a bale of hay!"
45568,Chandler,"Honey, are you seriously ever gonna wear the boots again?"
45570,Chandler,YÂ’know what? You can say goodbye to the tan ones.
45653,Chandler,"Honey, you remember my boss Doug right?"
45656,Chandler,"I didnÂ’t know you and Carol were getting divorced, IÂ’m sorry."
45665,Chandler,"Oh yeah. Boy, urine cuts right through an ice sculpture doesnÂ’t it?"
45741,Chandler,"Oh uh, as it turns out, we canÂ’t do it. Monica has to work."
45743,Chandler,Oh uh well tomorrowÂ’s no good for her either.
45745,Chandler,ItÂ’s the semi-finalsÂ…of herÂ…botchy ball tournament.
45747,Chandler,Well now-now youÂ’re just talking crazy.
45749,Chandler,Because uh... we-we... we split up. Monica and I split up. Hold me
45751,Chandler,Y'know what would really help me through this tough time is choking something. Can I choke ya?
45785,Chandler,"Oh thatÂ’s all right sir, and thatÂ’s just one girl."
45798,Chandler,Hi honey IÂ’m home.
45800,Chandler,"It was awful. To get out of going to dinner with Doug I told him that you and I split up. So then he took me to all these strip clubs and sleazy bars, and then when I wouldnÂ’t give him my wedding ring, he threw a soda can at a bird!"
45802,Chandler,"YÂ’know what the worse part was? I got to see what my life would be like without you. It was like ItÂ’s a Wonderful Life with lap dances. Please promise that you will never leave me, that we will grow old together, and be with each other for the rest of our lives."
45804,Chandler,"Ooh, I donÂ’t know if weÂ’re there yet."
45839,Chandler,Oh my goodness! Where did you hide it?
45847,Chandler,I kinda like it here.
45852,Chandler,Well what did it do?
45854,Chandler,A vending machine?
45880,Chandler,Who cares? ItÂ’s a stupid game.
45882,Chandler,I donÂ’t suck. ItÂ’s sucks. You suck.
45885,Chandler,Why do you want to play this game so bad?
45937,Chandler,You are not going to believe what I did today!
45942,Chandler,"Well IÂ’ve been playing it for like eight hours, itÂ’ll loosen up. Come on, check out the scores. Oh, and also look at the initials, theyÂ’re dirty words."
45944,Chandler,Because itÂ’s awesome.
45946,Chandler,"Well yÂ’know, they only give you three letters, so after A-S-S it is a bit of a challenge."
45948,Chandler,It is when you put it together with that one.
45950,Chandler,"Come on, he wonÂ’t even know what they mean."
45952,Chandler,Have you talked to him lately?
45956,Chandler,With the claw?!
46034,Chandler,All right! Go left! Go left! Go right!! Go right!!
46056,Chandler,"Are you, are you high?"
46058,Chandler,Really? I donÂ’t like baths.
46060,Chandler,"Honey, itÂ’s not the bath I enjoy, itÂ’s the wet, naked lady."
46062,Chandler,Really? What do you do? You just sit in there stewing in your own filth.
46064,Chandler,"Honey, itÂ’s 2:00 on a Wednesday and IÂ’m watching Road Rules, how stressed do you think I am?"
46066,Chandler,"Oh! Uh, yeah! Is this a cold pizza talk or a leftover meatloaf talk?"
46068,Chandler,"Oh my God, whatÂ’s up?!"
46070,Chandler,"Oh no-no, no you donÂ’t, just come back."
46076,Chandler,"Yes. When Monica and I were in London, we were both in London."
46078,Chandler,"If that.Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe and Rachel are sitting on the couch. Ross sits down.]"
46125,Chandler,Sex on the balcony?
46127,Chandler,What is it?
46129,Chandler,"Honey, I donÂ’t like baths! Could you draw me a picture of us having sex on the balcony?"
46131,Chandler,"Well, this does butch it up a bit."
46133,Chandler,"All right, if I do this, can we at least discuss sex on the balcony?"
46138,Chandler,Oh my God.
46140,Chandler,"IÂ’m going to need a bigger boat.Scene: The DoctorÂ’s Office, the doctor is writing something as Rachel is on the table, and Ross is standing.]"
46162,Chandler,"IÂ’m in the bathroom, can you come in here? I think thereÂ’s something wrong."
46164,Chandler,IÂ’m in the bathtub.
46166,Chandler,"I drew my own bath, but I did it wrong! The waterÂ’s tepid. The salt didnÂ’t dissolve and is nowÂ… lodged places. And the scents I used donÂ’t compliment each other. Eucalyptus and chamomileÂ—Oh!"
46169,Chandler,"Yeah! Sure, sure. So, what was going on with you today? Oh-oh-oh!"
46171,Chandler,I had the exact same conversation.
46174,Chandler,"All right, letÂ’s break this down. What exactly did he say to you?"
46178,Chandler,He didnÂ’t say anything about that to me.
46180,Chandler,"He was asking all these questions about you, me, and London. And, of course the glue that holds this all together, the rules."
46182,Chandler,But what did he mean by rules?
46184,Chandler,Because he was looking at her differently.
46186,Chandler,My God! He wants to do it with Phoebe in London!
46189,Chandler,You donÂ’t say anything.
46191,Chandler,IÂ’m not going to let you say anything.
46269,Chandler,Do I smell essential oils?
46273,Chandler,L-leaving my troubles behind?
46275,Chandler,"Oh, itÂ’s so hard to care when youÂ’re this relaxed."
46291,Chandler,You like Rachel?!
46302,Chandler,"IÂ’llÂ…IÂ’ll get you later!Scene: Joey and RachelÂ’s, Joey is sitting at the counter eating Cocoa Puffs.]"
46307,Chandler,Yeah. And what youÂ’re doing feels so good.
46311,Chandler,"Oh, sweet Lord. New realms of pleasure!"
46330,Chandler,"Hey Pheebs, whatÂ’s up?"
46335,Chandler,"Buy stamps, pick up dry cleaningÂ…DonÂ’t let Phoebe in."
46367,Chandler,Who says you canÂ’t get a nice punch bowl for under six bucks? Maybe we can take it back?
46369,Chandler,How about to the street say from the balcony?
46371,Chandler,Okay. How about in that cabinet?
46377,Chandler,"Oh yÂ’know, IÂ’ve been living here a while and IÂ’ve never seen whatÂ’s inside that closet. What is, what is in there?"
46379,Chandler,DonÂ’t try to make me uncomfortable with feminine stuff!
46420,Chandler,Monica has a secret closet and she wonÂ’t let me see whatÂ’s in it.
46422,Chandler,I donÂ’t know! What could she possibly be hiding in here that I canÂ’t see?!
46424,Chandler,Why would Monica be keeping Richard in here?
46426,Chandler,And here we go
46469,Chandler,There has got to be a way!
46473,Chandler,Maybe Monica has a bobby pin.
46475,Chandler,"So, howÂ’s the hideously inappropriate crush on Rachel coming?"
46477,Chandler,ThatÂ’s a good idea.
46548,Chandler,I married Fred Sanford!
46550,Chandler,"No, honey youÂ’re not sick! Look, I donÂ’t love you because youÂ’re organized, I love you in spite of that."
46552,Chandler,"Yes! And look, now that I know if I got some extra stuff lying around can we, can we share the closet."
46556,Chandler,So RachelÂ’s all moved out huh? How are you taking it?
46558,Chandler,Are you okay?
46614,Chandler,"Woah, woah, thatÂ’s not pretty!"
46619,Chandler,I am trying!Scene: JoeyÂ’s. Joey is playing fetch with the dog.
46632,Chandler,"ItÂ’s yellingÂ…bleedingÂ…dilating. Oh, the dilating"
46634,Chandler,I thoughtÂ…maybeÂ…you got me porn for ValentineÂ’s Day.
46636,Chandler,"Well, IÂ’m not really in a sexy mood right now."
46638,Chandler,"Well, remember the first time we saw Jaws?"
46640,Chandler,How long it took to go back in the water?
46642,Chandler,You donÂ’t know. You didnÂ’t see it.
46727,Chandler,"You know, it haunts me? Up Â‘til now, the worst thing I ever saw, was my father doing tequila shots off the naked houseboy. After this, I would gladly make that my screensaver!"
46729,Chandler,I can do that.
46733,Chandler,"Oh, I know!"
46738,Chandler,"Oh, great. We have to watch him do yoga in his underwear, but for this he closes the drapes!"
46740,Chandler,"Oh, and we should warn you, before you watch it: donÂ’t watch it."
46742,Chandler,"Well, letÂ’s just say itÂ’s ironic how footage of someone being born can make you want to kill yourself."
46749,Chandler,Why have I seen this thing three times?!
46754,Chandler,"Wait, you guys, look!"
46756,Chandler,"No, the babyÂ’s out! Look, look!"
46758,Chandler,And look how happy the mom is now!
46828,Chandler,I think thatÂ’s the youngest girl ever to reject me.
46835,Chandler,"No. I mean I believe that uh, certain people are more suited for each other and I believe in falling in love, but soul mates, I donÂ’t think they exist."
46847,Chandler,"A tall guy with hair similar to mine, oh unknowable universe!"
46854,Chandler,"Luckily, the guy she settled for canÂ’t hear what youÂ’re talking about."
46856,Chandler,You believe that this guy is destined for someone else and youÂ’re still gonna date him?
46895,Chandler,What are you doing?!
46897,Chandler,"I believe in tall, handsome strangers who hit on my wife!"
46936,Chandler,"Cheese you say? ThatÂ’s some pretty smelly work, huh Don?"
46938,Chandler,"Cheese, itÂ’s smelly. You must smell a lot of the time too."
46944,Chandler,Is it made of cheese?
46949,Chandler,What do we do?
46961,Chandler,"Sure, why donÂ’t you set it up. IÂ’ll just be over here, browsing through the personals."
46963,Chandler,"Yeah, fine. Fine. Not perfect!! But good enough."
46965,Chandler,"IÂ’m sorry, did you say cheese?"
46967,Chandler,"Phoebe thinks you and Don are soul mates, and I donÂ’t believe in that kind of stuff. But then you two totally get along. So look, I wonÂ’t stand in your way if you want to run off with Don and live in a house of cheese."
46973,Chandler,So youÂ…you donÂ’t want to live with Don in a cheese house?
46975,Chandler,I love you.
47039,Chandler,What?! No! No!
47052,Chandler,I didnÂ’t know you read tea leaves.
47063,Chandler,What does yours say Pheebs?
47070,Chandler,"Well, IÂ’m sure you get another one at Ann TaylorÂ’s."
47082,Chandler,"I know itÂ’s tough now, but things will get better."
47084,Chandler,"IÂ’m not great at the advice, can I interest you in a sarcastic comment? Some cheese?"
47086,Chandler,LetÂ’s just say if I canÂ’t find the right CD case I just put it in the nearest one.
47088,Chandler,In the James Taylor case.
47090,Chandler,"Honey, IÂ’m gonna save you some time, 200 CDs, not one of them in the right case."
47092,Chandler,"Well, if weÂ’re gonna do that we should come up with some kind of order. YÂ’know alphabetically or by genre?"
47136,Chandler,"Oh my God, honey we are so meant to be together. We both have copies of the Annie soundtrack."
47141,Chandler,What problem did you tell him you had?
47185,Chandler,You can always sell your baby.
47226,Chandler,"Wow, Ralph Lauren is really going out of there way to show theyÂ’re not in the baby buying business."
47228,Chandler,"Oh IÂ’m sorry, youÂ’re kicking me out of my own living room?"
47258,Chandler,And you wonder why Ross is their favorite?
47263,Chandler,What are you doing?
47265,Chandler,ItÂ’s a dog.
47267,Chandler,ItÂ’s your parentsÂ’ anniversary and youÂ’re going to talk about their dead pet?
47340,Chandler,I donÂ’t think the flash went off.
47344,Chandler,Somewhere there is someone with a tranquilizer gun and a huge butterfly net looking for that man.
47386,Chandler,What are you doinÂ’?
47495,Chandler,Is that gal pal spelled L-O-S-E-R?
47519,Chandler,And a bagel with only
47576,Chandler,It hurts me. It physically hurts me.
47602,Chandler,"Oh my God, introduce us!"
47666,Chandler,Hey Joe! You wanna shoot some hoops?
47671,Chandler,YouÂ’ll be perfect for this! ThatÂ’s already your name!
47676,Chandler,"Okay, I guess we can lose to junior high girls some other time."
47689,Chandler,What does a Wicked Wango card do?
47691,Chandler,Higher or lower than what?
47728,Chandler,Let me see that.
47733,Chandler,Fear of Triscuts?
47737,Chandler,This game makes no sense!
47739,Chandler,"Oh come on Ross, I think weÂ’re all losers here."
47741,Chandler,Let me think. Let me thinkÂ—Oh! I donÂ’t care.
47743,Chandler,"Either, it makes no difference."
47745,Chandler,IÂ’ll take a card.
47748,Chandler,This game is kinda fun.
47750,Chandler,I donÂ’t think the contestants are supposed to speak to each other.
47797,Chandler,Treasure of the Sierra Madre!
47799,Chandler,Madre Sierra the of Treasure!
47801,Chandler,IÂ’d like to go up the ladder of chance to the golden mud hut please.
47809,Chandler,Tell it to the Time Turtle!
47824,Chandler,IÂ’d like a Google Card.
47830,Chandler,This is the best game ever!!!
47942,Chandler,IÂ’m so sorry.
47974,Chandler,I have a job interview I have to get ready for.
47976,Chandler,"And people say you donÂ’t pay attention. No, this is a much better job. ItÂ’s vice-president of a company that does data reconfiguration and statistical factoring for other companies."
47978,Chandler,ThatÂ’s what I do now.
47984,Chandler,"The front page? You really do live in your own little world, donÂ’t ya?"
48018,Chandler,"Well, I got a job interview. ItÂ’s kinda a big deal too. Its a lot more money and IÂ’d be doing data reconfiguration and statistical factoring."
48020,Chandler,"Me! I do that. SoÂ… Seriously, do I look okay? IÂ’m little nervous."
48025,Chandler,What about it?
48029,Chandler,Are you serious?!
48031,Chandler,What is it that I do?
48070,Chandler,I canÂ’t even believe this! I really come off that badly?
48072,Chandler,"Oh good. Good, because IÂ’m sure this interview is gonna last a couple of weeks."
48094,Chandler,"I think youÂ’ll find if I come to work here, I donÂ’t micro-manage. I donÂ’t shy away from delegating."
48098,Chandler,Hardest thing IÂ’ve ever done in my life.
48128,Chandler,also I was the point person on my companyÂ’s transition from the KL-5 to GR-6 system.
48130,Chandler,That I did. That I did.
48138,Chandler,No donÂ’t I beg of you!
48144,Chandler,"Oh my God this doesnÂ’t count! Okay? The interview was over, that was the real Chandler Bing in there, this is just some crazy guy out in the hall! Call security! ThereÂ’s a crazy guy out in the hall!"
48215,Chandler,Hey! Did you have the baby yet?
48232,Chandler,"HeÂ’s not snoozing, heÂ’s teaching a class."
48234,Chandler,I havenÂ’t seen this dress.
48239,Chandler,You really want to take me?
48241,Chandler,So youÂ’re never actually going to pay me back?
48244,Chandler,I always knew you were gonna make it. IÂ’m so proud of you.
48261,Chandler,This is so exciting! ItÂ’s so glamorous! People taking our picture. How do I look?
48265,Chandler,ItÂ’s just so glamorous.
48323,Chandler,Good job Joe! Well done! Top notch!
48327,Chandler,The whole thing! Can we go?
48329,Chandler,"I love the specifics, the specifics were the best part!"
48331,Chandler,I was surprised to see a kangaroo in a World War I epic.
48361,Chandler,Where have you been?! I tried to call you! I want to talk to you! I still feel so bad!
48363,Chandler,IÂ’m so sorry.
48367,Chandler,"You donÂ’t owe me anything, I donÂ’t want you money"
48369,Chandler,"I donÂ’t know, five hundred dollars?"
48371,Chandler,"Well then there was the second set, the infamous booger head shots."
48373,Chandler,Do you want a calculator?
48377,Chandler,"Well uh, there was acting classes, stage combat classes, tap classes"
48379,Chandler,Uh then there was that dialect coach who helped you with that play where you needed a southern accent. Which after twenty hours of lessons still came out Jamaican.
48381,Chandler,"Yes, money well spent!"
48383,Chandler,"Okay, two, three years of rent, utilities, food"
48505,Chandler,"Okay. IÂ’ve been thinking about it too, and I, I think weÂ’re ready."
48509,Chandler,But you said you were ready too.
48511,Chandler,"Yes, but havenÂ’t you wanted a kid like forever?"
48581,Chandler,IÂ’m not crazy about babies. IÂ’m crazy about us.
48583,Chandler,"Look, weÂ’ve always talked about having babies someday. IÂ’m not saying it has to be right now, but IÂ’m starting to think that we can handle it. WeÂ’re good. WeÂ’re really good."
48585,Chandler,But nothing has to happen until your ready.
48587,Chandler,What?! ItÂ’s not right! WeÂ’re not ready to have a kid now!!
48589,Chandler,IÂ’m kidding. This is going to be fun.
48599,Chandler,"Wait a minute, itÂ’s perfect. We got a lot of time to kill and weÂ’re in a building thatÂ’s full of beds!"
48654,Chandler,"Yes, 98.6. YouÂ’re gonna be fine."
48738,Chandler,Should we tell Rachel thereÂ’s an empty private room right next door to hers?
48740,Chandler,"Well let me think about that, while I remove my pants!"
48743,Chandler,"If itÂ’s not, then thereÂ’s two of them. And that would mean itÂ’s the end of the world!"
48755,Chandler,Janice I didnÂ’t even know you were pregnant! WhoÂ’s the unwitting human whoÂ’s essence youÂ’ve stolen?
48759,Chandler,ThatÂ’s funny. Does it-does it hurt? Does the labor hurt?
48844,Chandler,"ItÂ’s incredible, I mean one minute sheÂ’s inside you and then 47 hours later here she is."
48856,Chandler,"So, do you know what youÂ’re gonna call her yet?"
48862,Chandler,So then I guess Ferdinad is out.
48873,Chandler,"Oh no, itÂ’s gonna be named after some snack or baked good isnÂ’t it?"
48886,Chandler,That was amazing.
48888,Chandler,"And if not, we got to do it on a bucket."
48971,Chandler,He pulled a quarter out of my ear!
48997,Chandler,That was you?! I thought it was Jack!
48999,Chandler,What?! Why does she think that?
49003,Chandler,As we all are at some point during the day.
49005,Chandler,Ross had a ring?! And he was gonna propose?
49007,Chandler,And you did it first?! This is gonna kill him! You know how much he loves to propose!
49009,Chandler,"Well, what did she say?"
49011,Chandler,Does Ross know?
49013,Chandler,Well maybe you donÂ’t have to tell him anything.
49015,Chandler,"If you clear things up with Rachel then Ross never needs to find out, but you have to do it now before he hears about it and kicks your ass!"
49018,Chandler,"Honey, weÂ’ve been over this. I need to be facing the other way."
49055,Chandler,"Hello sir, you know Monica."
49106,Chandler,"Look, we canÂ’t stay in here forever."
49111,Chandler,"I just want you to know that what you witnessed in there, that wasnÂ’t for fun."
49123,Chandler,"ThatÂ’s funny, this conversationÂ’s how I got the bullet hole in my head."
49129,Chandler,"Seriously sir, my brains? All over the wall."
49148,Chandler,You still havenÂ’t told Rachel you werenÂ’t really proposing?
49150,Chandler,"Joey, you have to tell her whatÂ’s going on! And what did it look like?!"
49152,Chandler,Go and tell Rachel right now before Ross finds out.
49154,Chandler,"Okay, look, just do it gently."
49260,Chandler,"CouldnÂ’t sleep last night you know, then I started worrying about this big divisional meeting that I have later today, the more I worried about it the more I couldnÂ’t sleep. YÂ’know? I was like, if I fall asleep now IÂ’ll get six hours sleep, but if I fall asleep now IÂ’ll get five hours sleep. Not matter what I did I couldnÂ’t fall asleep."
49275,Chandler,"Hey, what do I know? I wanted to get a bigger gorilla."
49378,Chandler,Monica can I talk to you outside for a minute?
49381,Chandler,Actually Pheebs its more of a husband and wife kinda thing
49384,Chandler,"Umm, you know how we always said that it would be fun to move to Paris for a year? You know, you could study French cooking and I could write and we could take a picnic along the Seine and go wine tasting in Bordeaux?"
49386,Chandler,"Okay, you know how that people say that Tulsa is the Paris of Oklahoma?"
49388,Chandler,People whoÂ’ve never ever been to Paris.
49392,Chandler,"Okay, Ms. McKenna, she kind of works above my boss, she asked me to move to Tulsa and be the president of our office there, and I was sleeping and apparently, said yes."
49394,Chandler,"The Sooner State, whatever that is."
49396,Chandler,Really? Oh What A Beautiful Morning! Surrey With A Fringe On Top.
49478,Chandler,Oh so there canÂ’t be any yelling.
49480,Chandler,WeÂ’re moving to Tulsa
49502,Chandler,"Okay, our news. My company has asked me to head up our office in Tulsa , so as of Monday I'm being officially relocated."
49508,Chandler,They said it could be up to a year.
49512,Chandler,"There is nothing like the support of your loving wife, huh?"
49514,Chandler,"I'm sorry buddy, but I don't think I'm gonna be able to make it."
49549,Chandler,I've got good news!
49551,Chandler,"Okay, I have news. You don't have to move to Tulsa. You can stay here and keep your job."
49555,Chandler,"I'm sorry, are you just used to saying that?"
49559,Chandler,That's fast math! We could use you in Tulsa.
49561,Chandler,"Hey, you said that without gagging!"
49599,Chandler,I know what she's talking about.
49606,Chandler,He saw a therapist?
49639,Chandler,Looking for restaurant jobs for you in Tulsa.
49643,Chandler,"No, 'Slim Pickings', it's a barbecue restaurant. They're looking for a cook. Actually 'cook' may be a bit of a stretch. They're looking for someone to shovel mesquite."
49645,Chandler,'So Cheesy' also has an opening.
49647,Chandler,Can I just say how much I appreciate you coming with me. When we get to Tulsa I'm taking you for a great dinner at 'Slim Pickings'. 'So Cheesy'? 'Whole Hog'? It's going to be tough to keep Kosher in Tulsa.
49683,Chandler,"Honey, we're leaving tomorrow you've still got a lot of packing to do."
49687,Chandler,How far outside?
49691,Chandler,What happened to 'you can't live without me four days a week'?
49693,Chandler,I think you should take the job.
49695,Chandler,Yeah. I know it must be important to you when you start chattering like a monkey.
49705,Chandler,Diagnostician or boo-boo fixer?
49708,Chandler,Does he say that before he sticks his thermometer in your touchy?
49710,Chandler,That was not a security blanket! That was a wall-hanging!
49756,Chandler,Of course I will call you. I love you.
49764,Chandler,Any chance you are trying to pick a fight to make all this easier?
49766,Chandler,"Well, bye Mon, bye Ross, Rachel, bye Emma!"
49882,Chandler,Ok honey. that was close.
49970,Chandler,Hi honey I'm home!
49972,Chandler,oh it was great.
49974,Chandler,"well, well, well it must be five in Tulsa because it's six o clock IN NY.C!"
49978,Chandler,no I'm not quite sure you got the right movie that's all.
49980,Chandler,does what always have to be sharks.
49982,Chandler,What's going on?
49984,Chandler,let ME be a part of this!
49986,Chandler,no they don't
49988,Chandler,"OH MY GOD! When you came in I switched the channel, I was just watching regular porn"
49990,Chandler,yeah just some good old fashion girl on girl American action.
50034,Chandler,"Actually, in Oklahoma smoking is legal in all commune areas and offices with fewer than fifteen people."
50036,Chandler,"No! I just happened tdo a lot trivias about smoking in different states. For example, in Hawaii cigarettes are called Leyhallalookoos."
50038,Chandler,"Uch, do you think, Monica is gonna be able smell it?"
50044,Chandler,"No thanks, Im good."
50052,Chandler,"But, those are for you."
50086,Chandler,"I messed up, it was a meeting, everybody was smoking."
50090,Chandler,"kay, look: Can we just drop this? Im not gonna smoke again."
50092,Chandler,You forbid me?
50094,Chandler,"You know, I flew a long way t see my loving wife? Is she here by the way?"
50096,Chandler,"Oh, would you say this was the most upset you could be?"
50104,Chandler,"Right, fine, Ill do it, but no talking."
50106,Chandler,And no kissing your neck.
50108,Chandler,And lots of kissing your neck.
50139,Chandler,"Look, I cant do this. I cant make luv to you while were fighting this way."
50141,Chandler,"That was a celebration of life. Alright, look, Im not gonna do this. Alright, is this really the way you want a baby to be conceived?"
50147,Chandler,"Yeah, lets celebrate life!"
50154,Chandler,Uhh. You are welcome.
50158,Chandler,But you said you forgave me. It was just a couple of cigarettesno big deal.
50162,Chandler,You tricked me to get me into bed?
50164,Chandler,I feel so used.
50196,Chandler,I would never lie to get someone into bed.
50198,Chandler,I suppose that Monica will have the  manipulative shrew.
50203,Chandler,You mean the lully story?
50222,Chandler,"Oh yeah, thats what she says. But maybe youre not ovulating at all, maybe its just a clever ruse to get me into bed."
50226,Chandler,Whats the matter with me? Why Im such a girl?
50238,Chandler,"So you never had sex with a Kennedy, have you?"
50254,Chandler,"Honey, you're screaming."
50338,Chandler,"Yeah, he came up..."
50374,Chandler,Monica says that her Maitre D. is the funniest guy she's ever met.
50376,Chandler,Yes! Am I crazy to be this upset?
50455,Chandler,What are you guys talking about?
50468,Chandler,Oh yeah? Is he funnier than me?
50470,Chandler,"I do limericks... uhm... There once was a man named Chandler, whose wife made him die inside."
50525,Chandler,"Well, I'm off to Tulsa, so if your Maitre D. friend has any funny Oklahoma jokes, tell him to e-mail me at www.hahanotsomuch.com."
50527,Chandler,"Really...? See... that's the thing: you gotta keep it smart, people!"
50576,Chandler,Do you have any ideas?
50585,Chandler,"Oh, well... Maybe I'll join them some time. I just hope the club doesn't slip out of my hand and beat the moustache off his face."
50620,Chandler,So how come Richard's selling the place? Went bankrupt? Medical malpractice? Choked on his own moustache?
50622,Chandler,mmm That's enough about you!
50625,Chandler,"No, no, no, no, no, NO! No, no... we're not together. We're not a couple. We're definately not a couple."
50632,Chandler,There's a tape here with Monica's name on it.
50691,Chandler,"Don't judge me, I'm only human!"
50693,Chandler,"I had to! Okay, imagine you were married... and you found a tape of your wife in another guys' apartment... Wouldn't you need to know what was on it?"
50701,Chandler,Then you're gonna have to watch it for me.
50703,Chandler,"Just for a few seconds, so I can know what it is... Please?"
50705,Chandler,Why am I hearing cheering?
50707,Chandler,Football? Just football?
50733,Chandler,Whoho ho... Listen to the judgement from the porn star!
50737,Chandler,"Because that's who I am, okay? I'm sure a mature man like Richard could see a tape like that and it wouldn't bother him. Just'd be another saucy anecdote for him to share at his men's club over brandy and moustaches."
50739,Chandler,This is about you and Richard. He's clearly not over you. He keeps a tape so he can... look at it whenever he wants.
50741,Chandler,"Oh, yeah, well, poor Richard. Y'... I can grow a moustache!"
50743,Chandler,"Yeah, oh, but I just keep picturing you rolling around with him with your cowboy boots in the air..."
50745,Chandler,"Oh, good, good. Play more, 'cause I wanna see how it ends."
50747,Chandler,What...? That's not you! Life is good again! Ride 'em cowgirl!
50749,Chandler,Is that a problem?
50789,Chandler,"Yeah. Hey, here's an idea, why don't we use our wedding china today?"
50791,Chandler,"Honey, she keeps canceling on us, take the hint."
50793,Chandler,What is the point of having them if we never use them?
50795,Chandler,I will explain it to her.
50799,Chandler,Muskogee! That's like four hours from Tulsa. Woo hoo! TV announcer: And heres the float with the stars of the popular daytime soap Days of Our Lives .
50802,Chandler,Aren't you one of the stars of the popular daytime soap Days of Our Lives?
50806,Chandler,What are you going to do?
50808,Chandler,Well you proved them wrong.
50854,Chandler,"I'll tell you what, for the rest of our lives, I'll be careful until told otherwise. <looks at china> hey wait a minute this isn't the china we picked out.."
50858,Chandler,"Oh suddenly, flowers are feminine? < Phoebe comes in>"
50940,Chandler,I can't believe you'd want us to raise Emma.
50945,Chandler,"You know, guys I got to say. This means so much to me. That you would trust me with your child. I mean, we all know that Monica and I have been trying to have a baby of our own. You know I've had my doubts about my skills as a father, but that you two.. that you two.... <starts to cry>"
50966,Chandler,"No, if crazy plate lad.. <sees Monica frustrated at this comment> If Monica dies then I would get Emma, Right?"
50976,Chandler,"So if Monica's not around, then I'm not good enough to raise Emma?"
50980,Chandler,Well what is wrong with me? Am I .. am I incomptent? Because I managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you!
50985,Chandler,"Look, I may not know a lot about babies, but do you really think I'm not capable?"
50987,Chandler,Ok. So if we both had Emma and I die <knocks on table> she'd have to give her up.
50990,Chandler,"So.. let me get this straight. So my two friends die, I get Emma. Then my wife dies, then Emma the one tiny ray of hope left in my life gets taken away from me?"
50994,Chandler,Oh? Did somebody miss me? Is there a child to raise poorly?
50996,Chandler,"Yeah but they're right. I mean, I'm not a strong father figure and I never will be."
50998,Chandler,"Yeah, but its not who I am. Everything they said was exaclty why I was worried about having a kid. And its true. And look everybody knows it."
51000,Chandler,"Oh yeah, well can you picture me saying ""Go to your room! You're grounded""?"
51002,Chandler,You said that to me last week.
51020,Chandler,"Oh no thats okay, you're totally right. I don't know anything about disciplining a child. But it did hurt my feelings and I want you to know that when I die, you don't get Joey."
51076,Chandler,"Alright! That is it. This is our apartment and you can not behave this way. Now if you can't act your age then you shouldn't be here at all. Now those plates may not be as nice as the pretty pink ones I picked out, but they're very important to Monica. I want you to apologize to her right now."
51079,Chandler,Okay. Thats better. Now I want you to both apologize to each other and mean it.
51081,Chandler,"By the way, that fight was totally arousing."
51083,Chandler,Oh yeah? Well thanks.
51085,Chandler,"Okay, but you should know he eats five times a day and shoves pennies up his nose."
51099,Chandler,"Oh no no no.. I'll get her. I'm super-compentent and totally responsibile and fourth in line to raise Emma. I'll be right there Emma. Just let me get my trusty diaper bag here. <knocks over the box of china> Well.. what do you know? I guess, I'll be the one who dies first."
51394,Chandler,"Yeah, we have all this paperwork that needs to be filed by the end of the year. If I don't get it done, I'll be fired."
51396,Chandler,"So, who does?"
51401,Chandler,"I'm sorry, I won't be here."
51405,Chandler,Did I not mention that?
51411,Chandler,Hey. Where've you been?
51417,Chandler,"Well, that's like money in your pocket! - Alright look, you want me to say it? This sucks. Being here sucks! This work sucks!"
51419,Chandler,"I'm sorry. Hey, at least you guys get to go home and be with your families tonight. I have to go back to an empty hotel room and lay down on a very questionable bedspread. And then tomorrow morning, you get to have Christmas morning in your own houses, wich, by the way, none of you have invited me to."
51421,Chandler,"Haha, no thanks!"
51423,Chandler,"Oh, thanks! I'm... actually thinking about becoming a motivational speaker."
51425,Chandler,"Typical Christmas-y stuff, you know? Our holidays are pretty traditional..."
51431,Chandler,"I can save you time ladies, I'm right here."
51434,Chandler,What? That's terrible!
51436,Chandler,"Oh well, that, that makes it not terrible."
51439,Chandler,"No not okay, you can't look for Monica's presents!"
51441,Chandler,"No, you don't have to, and you can't because I, I live here too."
51445,Chandler,"No, I have a great idea for a present for her."
51448,Chandler,"If I help, we can find 'em faster!"
51458,Chandler,"OK, Pheebs, your turn."
51464,Chandler,"And, a lemon lime."
51466,Chandler,And last but not least.
51477,Chandler,"Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weird...turtle-man?"
51482,Chandler,"You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!"
51486,Chandler,But I didn't get to shake my belly like a bowl full of jelly.
51488,Chandler,"Fine, I'll give the suit back."
51492,Chandler,Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?
51495,Chandler,"You know what, everybody? Go home. You should be with your families. It's bad enough that we're working New Year's Eve."
51496,Chandler,"Did I not tell *anyone* about New Year's Eve? -- Alright, look, go! Go home, okay? Merry Christmas! Go."
51505,Chandler,"Ahh, Merry Christmas; I miss you guys!"
51507,Chandler,"Ah, well no, it's just uh, me and Wendy."
51509,Chandler,It is. Did I... not tell you about her?
51511,Chandler,I sent them home.
51515,Chandler,I don't know!
51517,Chandler,"I don't think of her that way, you know, she's a, she's a colleague."
51519,Chandler,"Oh, she's regional Vice President; She's... just below me."
51524,Chandler,"Well, she... she didn't win..."
51526,Chandler,"Well, second prettiest that year; I mean, of *all* the girls in Oklahoma, she's probably..."
51528,Chandler,"Honey, there's really nothing to worry about."
51534,Chandler,"Merry Christmas, you guys!"
51539,Chandler,"Ah well, she's got this weird idea, that, uh, y'know, just because you and I are alone, that something is gonna happen."
51541,Chandler,"This is probably the wrong thing to be worrying about, but... you're getting ham on my only tie."
51548,Chandler,I'm *happily* married.
51550,Chandler,"Right. So, I'm sorry..."
51552,Chandler,"Well look, it's not easy to spend this much time apart, you know. She's entitled to be a little paranoid... or, in this case: right on money! ... You know, she's amazing, and beautiful, and smart, and if she were here right now, ...she'd kick your ass. Look, you're a really nice person... ham stealing and adultery aside. But, what I have with my wife is pretty great, so nothing is ever gonna happen between us."
51554,Chandler,"I mean, you were the most beautiful woman in the room tonight!"
51558,Chandler,But we don't do that.
51560,Chandler,How drunk are you?
51573,Chandler,It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.
51577,Chandler,Count of three?
51582,Chandler,Well I think it's safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.
51585,Chandler,"So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?"
51587,Chandler,"Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary... Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. I am *so* bad at this."
51589,Chandler,"Really? Okay, so..."
51591,Chandler,"Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?"
51599,Chandler,"Oh, okay, I have condom in my wallet that I've had since I was twelve."
51601,Chandler,I don't think so.
51605,Chandler,"No, we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress."
51611,Chandler,"Look, I thought about it too, and I'm sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding."
51613,Chandler,"Yeah, I'm putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy, then, then that's what we're gonna do."
51615,Chandler,"Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids, y'know? We'll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college."
51619,Chandler,"Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy."
51621,Chandler,"Well, stuff like where we'd live, y'know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old."
51623,Chandler,Sure you do.
51627,Chandler,I love you so much.
51642,Chandler,I wanted to be with you. I missed you so much.
51646,Chandler,I never want to leave you again!
51648,Chandler,Turns out they can't fire me. Because I quit.
51651,Chandler,"Yeah! It's a stupid job, and I could not stand leaving you. And why should I be the only one who doesn't get to do what he *really* wants to do?"
51655,Chandler,"I know, I, I should have talked to you first about it."
51666,Chandler,"I... thought it was a timely start to thinking about other people. Besides, this gift still says I love you guys."
51668,Chandler,I don't have a *job*!
51674,Chandler,"Oh, she's at home, putting up decorations for Rachel's birthday party tonight."
51676,Chandler,"I tried, but apparantly singing ""I will survive"" in a helium voice - not helping."
51692,Chandler,"Yes, Bravo on the hot nanny."
51694,Chandler,Are you kidding? If I wasn't married she'd be rejecting me right now.
51700,Chandler,Now that Rachel's gone?
51744,Chandler,I wasn't staring. I was leering.
51747,Chandler,Looks like Joey is doing allright with her.
51782,Chandler,"Seriously dude, 3 years ago."
51784,Chandler,You don't trust him?
51786,Chandler,"Is this really your long term plan, for me to run interference? Because I could get a job any day now."
51788,Chandler,"Allright, fine, but don't blame me if it doesn't work. Because you know as well as I do that once Joey sets his mind on something, more often than not, he's going to have sex with it."
51790,Chandler,Picturing that tree?
51792,Chandler,"Where you going, Joe?"
51794,Chandler,Oh. You mind if I join you?
51796,Chandler,Your thoughts? Plural?
51798,Chandler,"I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Joe."
51800,Chandler,"Yes, as a matter of fact he did, so I can't let you go."
51917,Chandler,"Oh, uh, well, I haven't seem it but if I do I'll let you know."
51970,Chandler,"See, now, why would you assume that? Just because we're married? I will have you know that we are very hip, happening people. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to reading the obituaries."
51979,Chandler,"Well, I think it's great that you're going on a date, you know? I mean, it sounds healthy. I mean, you have needs. Embrace your womanhood!"
51984,Chandler,Suddenly I wish I was reading my own name.
52012,Chandler,"Emma? Emma? Look at me! Well, I think I'll go downstairs for a while."
52013,Chandler,"No, no, no, no! No, no, no, no! It's okay, it's okay. I didn't go. Don't cry, it's just a bit! I'm your uncle Chandler; funny is all I have!"
52015,Chandler,I don't do that.
52016,Chandler,"I'll try to stop. Wait, did you say until the sixth?"
52018,Chandler,Today is the sixth.
52020,Chandler,"Yes, it's also 2003."
52022,Chandler,It's okay. Go take the test and see if we're okay.
52026,Chandler,I might have checked to see if I was ovulating a couple times.
52028,Chandler,I am not working. There's not much to do around here!
52039,Chandler,"Oh, good, because as of four o'clock this afternoon, I am not."
52041,Chandler,I - I don't think I can.
52043,Chandler,Because of Emma.
52047,Chandler,"Well, she's aware when we leave the room. She may notice if we start... canoodling in it."
52049,Chandler,"Well, I can't say ""hump"" or ""screw"" in front of the B-A-B-Y."
52051,Chandler,Horrifying? Scarring? Something people go to jail for?
52053,Chandler,"You guess I'm right? When we stayed at that bed and breakfast, you wouldn't have sex with me because you thought a deer was staring through the window."
52087,Chandler,Emma was doing it!
52089,Chandler,"Ooh, she's asleep, that means we can..."
52091,Chandler,"Okay, I'll try. And you can't make any noise."
52111,Chandler,I think we may have really done it this time.
52113,Chandler,You may wanna get some more of those too.
52116,Chandler,"Don't ask me, I was in there canoodling you!"
52138,Chandler,"All right, all right, we were. We were trying to make a baby. Monica's ovulating."
52140,Chandler,"No, no, no."
52147,Chandler,Your family name is Tribbiani.
52199,Chandler,"Actually, it pays nothing. It's an internship."
52203,Chandler,"Well, it's a training program, but at the end, they hire the people they like."
52205,Chandler,"Yeah, I mean, there's probably gonna be some ground work which will probably stink, you know, grown man getting people coffee is a little humiliating"
52240,Chandler,"Oh, no, no, I'm an intern, just like you guysÂ… except for the tie, the briefcaseÂ… and the fact that I can rent a car."
52242,Chandler,"Yeah, well, I'm kinda heading into a new career direction and, you know, you gotta start at the bottom."
52245,Chandler,The comedian? USO?!
52312,Chandler,I am so much older than these other interns. I can't compete with them.
52317,Chandler,They're these prototype sneakers and come up with ideas on how to sell them which I can't do because no self-respecting adult would ever where these.
52319,Chandler,What am I supposed to do with these?
52323,Chandler,"No, I don't think that's the kinda thing they're looking for."
52388,Chandler,"Putting on the sneakersÂ… thought I'd get into a younger mindset, you know, to see if it sparked anything"
52390,Chandler,"Yes, how's this: They're so uncomfortable it's like getting kicked in the nuts for your feet!"
52426,Chandler,"A-huh. So he's rolling down the street and he starts to lose control, you knowÂ… maybe he fallsÂ… maybe hurts himself. Just then, a kid comes flying by wearing the shoes. He jumps over the old guy and laughs, and the line reads: ""Not suitable for adults!"""
52433,Chandler,The cold weather hurts my hip!
52465,Chandler,Did you see our bank statement? Can this be right?
52467,Chandler,"I'm not sure what they did, but I'm inclined to blame Enron."
52469,Chandler,Maybe I should quit and get a job that pays.
52471,Chandler,You know what? You know what? I think we're making too big a deal out of this. ok? So we pay our bills a little late this month and maybe next month we cut back on a few things. And maybe we start eating out of Joey's refrigerator for a change. You're chef... what can you make out of backing soda and beer?
52473,Chandler,No! We're not borrowing money.
52475,Chandler,Because we don't do that. We are Bings! And if there's one thing my father taught me was... well to always knock before going into the pool house... but the other thing was never borrow money.
52477,Chandler,That's right! I do! And I'm your man. And I'm going to get us through this situation even if it means you working twice as hard.
52530,Chandler,Yeah.... she's not so cute.
52552,Chandler,Listen er..I need to ask you a favor but you can't tell Monica anything about it.
52556,Chandler,What? What do you mean you know?
52560,Chandler,"Anyway, err... I need to borrow some money."
52568,Chandler,I can't believe her! Did she tell you we were having money problems?
52572,Chandler,What would she get for herself for two thousand dollars that she wouldn't tell me about?
52603,Chandler,Hey Rach! There she is...My perfectly proportioned wife.
52606,Chandler,Oh no..don't thank me. Thank you. You know there's not one thing I would change about you? Not one single thing! And definitely not... two... single things.
52608,Chandler,"No no! I just love the way you look, I am warm, for your form."
52610,Chandler,"Well yes yes... You look nice can mean that your face looks nice. I want to compliment your body. I mean..I wouldn't change it. At all. And more specifically, I wouldn't want anything to get any bigger."
52612,Chandler,"I mean, You wouldn't want any part of me to get any bigger would you? Don't answer that."
52649,Chandler,But honey you don't have to.
52651,Chandler,Honey I... I love your breasts the way they are!
52658,Chandler,God why why would you want to do that to yourself!?
52660,Chandler,"Alright look, if it means that much to you, a may be able to get on more with the big boobs. But the giant ass and the big clown feet?"
52681,Chandler,"Well! We er..climbed up four flights of stairs, manueveored a narrow hallway, dodged a rabid pitbul... but these last three feet are where it gets really tricky."
52712,Chandler,Hey! Ready to go?
52715,Chandler,What are you doin'?
52717,Chandler,"Great, a faster way to tell people that I'm unemployed and childless ."
52719,Chandler,The tall girl who wouldn't sleep with you?
52721,Chandler,Bet she'd sleep with you now...
52746,Chandler,"Oh, I'm so sorry!"
52748,Chandler,You're not gonna need my help?
52758,Chandler,I believe I read that somewhere!
52760,Chandler,I respectfully disagree.
52762,Chandler,Who cares? Nobody reads those things
52764,Chandler,I don't have a page.
52774,Chandler,Because I told everyone he slept with dinosaurs.
52776,Chandler,Would you get that please? People have been calling to congratulate me all day.
52780,Chandler,"Oh, you'll see my friend."
52784,Chandler,"Well, how you died was funny."
52786,Chandler,It kills over one americans every year.
52788,Chandler,You wanna talk about people's feelings? You should have heard how hurt professor Stern was yesterday when I told him I wouldn't be able to go with him to Key West!
52863,Chandler,Huh! So that's what I would look like if I worked out... and was being serviced by a policeman. You're not actually going to send these out are ya?
52865,Chandler,"No, come on, you know that's not true."
52867,Chandler,"Well, the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community."
52869,Chandler,"Alright look, let's think about this, ok, do you really think that people are gonna stir up your family at this tragic time? That people are gonna post condolences on a website? This is not about people not caring that you're dead .This is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief."
52871,Chandler,"Right, I mean, come on, I'm sure that if you had a funeral or a memorial service, tons of people would come."
52875,Chandler,"Ross, don't press send, don't press se... !"
52927,Chandler,There you go! Someone came!
52932,Chandler,"Oh yes, yes... let me... take your coat."
52936,Chandler,"Some guy, Tom Gordon."
52947,Chandler,"Please, one ridiculous problem at a time!"
52949,Chandler,"You gave them one day's notice, not everyone in our class checks the web site everyday and Monica... it's probably the way you stand!"
52951,Chandler,"Oh, that's not true. You had an impact on me, I mean, it's 15 years later and we're still best friends. Doesn't that count for something?"
52955,Chandler,Kori? Kori Weston?
52957,Chandler,Wow! You look amazing!
52959,Chandler,"Chandler, Chandler Bing. I'm not gay, I'm not gay at all."
52963,Chandler,I didn't know Ross and you were so close.
52965,Chandler,"I'm sure that would mean a lot to him. And if heaven has a door, I'm sure he's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently."
52986,Chandler,"Yeah, because if I was at my old job we'd say 300 million? No thank you!"
52993,Chandler,Still on Amelia Earhart?
52997,Chandler,Yes but there's six of us so we'd only have to get struck by lightning 7 times.
53005,Chandler,Kinda like Joey.
53008,Chandler,Pie eating contest?
53010,Chandler,"No, I saw a picture of you covered in blueberries."
53034,Chandler,One of the slots got filled.
53036,Chandler,Sense the tone! No that kid Nate got it.
53038,Chandler,Yeah I know.
53040,Chandler,"Yeah...I mean I want this so much! I mean, I wanna get one, I want my friend Charlie to get one...Except I don't care about Charlie."
53064,Chandler,"I can see the headline now: ""Lottery winners' friend filled with regret eats own arm""."
53066,Chandler,"Well you wouldn't, but we own the paper, we can print whatever we want."
53072,Chandler,"Ok, so now that you're in, what are you gonna do if we win?"
53074,Chandler,Ooh! Calm down ...
53081,Chandler,"You know, I'm not sure a sports team is the way to go."
53083,Chandler,"You're right, it has been you dream for over 15 seconds."
53095,Chandler,"Well no, Charlie's gonna get that."
53097,Chandler,He's the boss's son.
53105,Chandler,What about the ones you have on the nightstand?
53107,Chandler,"Yes there are, I just saw them a few minutes ago."
53109,Chandler,"Honey, there are like 20 tickets on the nightstand!"
53135,Chandler,"Oh, yeah! Thanks for inventing the lottery!"
53146,Chandler,"Can I come a little bit closer, valuable things are getting squished..."
53171,Chandler,"Oh, is she related to Ralph Lauren?"
53183,Chandler,I got that!
53218,Chandler,"Oh no no no no, I'd love to be somebody's assistant! Answering phones, getting coffee, I live for that stuff! And I'm not too mature... farts, boobies, butt cracks!"
53220,Chandler,"Me, that guy who just said butt cracks?"
53226,Chandler,Does that mean I get the good loving tonight?
53246,Chandler,"Wow, you'd think we should get that over 20 years or go for the big payout."
53285,Chandler,"So, what do you say? Can you get out of work?"
53287,Chandler,Are you really that busy?
53294,Chandler,I don't have travel insurance.
53352,Chandler,"Hi, Chandler Bing, I have a reservation."
53356,Chandler,"I'm sorry, he's a little bit wound up, we had to stop at every maple candy stand on the way here."
53359,Chandler,"Well, that's impossible, can you check again, please?"
53363,Chandler,"Let me get this straight. I called yesterday trying to cancel my reservation and I was told it was not refundable, then we drove six hours all the way up here and now you tell me that we don't have a reservation?"
53366,Chandler,Just give us the cheapest room you have.
53374,Chandler,"Great, at a hundred dollars an apple, we're there!"
53376,Chandler,"Dude, you're shaking!"
53406,Chandler,And I also got... two more apples.
53408,Chandler,I also got this great salt and pepper shaker from the restaurant.
53416,Chandler,"Yes, but the batteries..."
53417,Chandler,"Thank you, thank you very much!"
53462,Chandler,"Oh we did, and you still have all your lamps."
53463,Chandler,"Oh, I didn't factor in the room tax."
53468,Chandler,"Look, we have enough, just walk away."
53470,Chandler,There's a forest right outside.
53472,Chandler,"Ok, go quick!"
53529,Chandler,I could fall asleep at a play.
53571,Chandler,"Yes, but, Ross you chose a career of talking about dinosaurs."
53698,Chandler,Where the hell is everybody?
53749,Chandler,I... I don't know... you seem lovely.
53782,Chandler,Well you should be. You missed the most powerful three hours in the history of the theater.
53786,Chandler,"Oh yeah, I had no idea the amazing journey you go through as a woman! Tell me, tell me about your first period!"
53788,Chandler,Did somebody sign your bra?
53816,Chandler,"Oh well, this was a really important experience for me, and I wanted to share it with you."
53879,Chandler,We really need to take those tests?
53881,Chandler,But I don't wanna do it in a cup!
53883,Chandler,It's weird! In a doctor's office?
53887,Chandler,"Yeah, ok. I'm sure that doctor's office can't be worst than on a class trip to the Hershey's factory!"
53889,Chandler,"Oh, yeah! RACHEL TALKS TOO!"
53965,Chandler,"Deposit my specimen? You know, usually I have to call a 900 number for that kind of talk. Thanks, got it."
53967,Chandler,"Yeah, I guess!"
53970,Chandler,"Oh, Come on!"
53973,Chandler,Why are you here?
54014,Chandler,Yeah! yeah... The hard part is over!
54016,Chandler,I haven't... I haven't even thought about the results yet... I just assumed that everything was gonna be ok.
54078,Chandler,Doctor Connelly just called.
54080,Chandler,Actually it's both of us.
54082,Chandler,Apparently my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitable environment.
54090,Chandler,"Well, we're gonna... we're gonna figure this out."
54129,Chandler,"Oh, I can't believe my sperm have low motility because, let me tell you, when I was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places!!"
54136,Chandler,"Oh, DAMN IT!"
54160,Chandler,"I think I can safely say that we all have family issues, work stuff and/or are sick."
54162,Chandler,But you come first!
54169,Chandler,Not as much fun as last time. Apparently you only get porn if you're giving a sperm sample.
54171,Chandler,"Well... there's surrogacy, but Monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child, she has felt that watching a surrogate would be... too hard for her."
54175,Chandler,"Aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination, so... we're talking about sperm donors."
54179,Chandler,I wish there was an easier way for us to have a child but I don't think there is one.
54226,Chandler,"Hey! Look I brought a friend for dinner, this is Zack, from work!"
54234,Chandler,"So, how would you like to have a baby that's half yours and half his!"
54236,Chandler,"Well, we're talking about sperm donors and Zack may be the guy! I mean, look, he's intelligent, he's healthy, he's athletic, I mean, he is ""spermtastic""!"
54238,Chandler,"No, I invited him to dinner so you could get a chance to get to know him! I mean, if we go through a sperm bank you never meet the guy, get to check him out."
54240,Chandler,"I'm telling you, he's great! I mean, even if my sperm worked fine, I'd think he'd be the way to go!"
54278,Chandler,"So what do you think? I want that guys genes for my kid! Those eyes, those cheeckbones!"
54280,Chandler,You don't like him.
54282,Chandler,Alright! Just follow my lead!
54284,Chandler,"Oh! Thanks, I'm crazy about our place. Hey! speaking of crazy... do you have a history of mental illness in the family?"
54298,Chandler,I noticed you were enjoying that Ravioli with a beautiful set of teeth. Did you have braces as a child?
54361,Chandler,You sure you don't wanna stick around a little longer?
54363,Chandler,"Are you just tired now or are you always tired, 'cause that could be a sign of clinical depression."
54366,Chandler,I think we've found our sperm!
54368,Chandler,"Yeah, you think so, well? Should I ask him?"
54370,Chandler,"Why not, just because his great-grandmother was obese, our kids are gonna get that from you anyway!"
54372,Chandler,"Yeah, he's better!"
54374,Chandler,Really? Are you sure?
54378,Chandler,So you know this leaves us with...
54380,Chandler,How do you feel about that?
54382,Chandler,Me too. I wanna find a baby that needs a home and I wanna raise it with you. And I wanna mess it up in our own specific way.
54386,Chandler,We are gonna be great parents.
54388,Chandler,"Wait, if we're lucky, and we're really really really quiet, we may be able to hear the sound of a condom breaking!"
54391,Chandler,"Look, I just wanted to apologize for last night. I got the feeling we made you a little uncomfortable."
54395,Chandler,"My wife and I have some boundary issues, you know, sometimes we ask inappropriate questions. We're working on it."
54398,Chandler,"You wouldn't know if Jeanette's planning on keeping her baby, would ya?"
54407,Chandler,"Yeah Ross, I mean... we're excited to hear the speech but the rest of the time we're gonna wanna do, you know, ""island's stuff""."
54438,Chandler,"Yeah, that's the same as ""it has something to do with wind""."
54455,Chandler,I wouldn't read too much into it.
54457,Chandler,"David, let me stop you there 'cause I think I see where this is going. I'm not very good at giving advice. So if you want advice, go to Ross, Monica, or... Joey, if the thing you wanna advice about is pizza toppings or burning sensation when you pee."
54459,Chandler,"Seriously, we're gonna do this?"
54465,Chandler,I didn't mean now...
54467,Chandler,"Well, you're welcome! Glad I could help."
54469,Chandler,"David, I'm pretending to read here!!"
54502,Chandler,David is going to propose to Phoebe.
54504,Chandler,"Be-cause, we were talking about ways that he could beat Mike and I told him that Phoebe wanted to get married."
54506,Chandler,"I did! A penis one! Look, just so I know, what was so wrong about what I said?"
54508,Chandler,"Man, that's some bad advice!"
54514,Chandler,That's why our honeymoon photos look like me and Diana Ross!
54529,Chandler,David is going to propose to Phoebe tonight!
54531,Chandler,That would be advice!!
54549,Chandler,"Oh, is it on the computer, cuz I'd love to give it a read...?"
54557,Chandler,"Your computer, I don't know wha... everything's gone!"
54559,Chandler,It must be a virus. I think it erased your hard drive.
54561,Chandler,Someone I don't know sent me an e-mail and I opened it.
54563,Chandler,"Well, it didn't say ""This is a virus""!!"
54567,Chandler,"It's not gone! I mean, I'm sure you printed out a copy. You have a hard copy, right?"
54569,Chandler,"Well, you must be pretty mad at yourself right now...!"
54572,Chandler,I just feel awful.
54600,Chandler,"Phoebe is going to say ""yes""? That's, that's great!"
54602,Chandler,And there's not chance that will work?
54606,Chandler,This vacation sucks!!
54684,Chandler,"You know, it's very hard to take you seriously when you look like that."
54711,Chandler,"I wouldn't brag too much about that thing, big guy."
54725,Chandler,"Oh, ain't this nice? It's so quiet, I could just lie here all day."
54728,Chandler,I'm so glad we've got adjoining rooms!
54730,Chandler,Hey! Remember when I had corneas?
54732,Chandler,Ladies? Ross's speech is in 45 minutes.
54782,Chandler,I don't think so!
54784,Chandler,"Because you know how competitive you get and well, I say it's cute, others disagree, and I'm lying!"
54786,Chandler,"Oh, yeah? What happened when we played last time?"
54810,Chandler,I'm not playing with you.
54834,Chandler,"Honey, try to focus the trash talk on him!"
54911,Chandler,I think this is the first time in our marriage that I've felt like the more attractive one.
54920,Chandler,"Okay-dokay, you've each won a game and I've lost what's felt like a year of my life. So everybody goes home a winner."
54923,Chandler,Should I use my invisibility to fight crime or for evil?
54949,Chandler,"Monica, that was also true an hour ago! I mean, please, look at you! Your hand is blistered, you can barely stand, your hair is inexplicable! Ok, you've already proven you are just as good as he is, now we've missed our dinner reservations, so now let's just go upstairs, order room service, take a shower and shave your head!"
54953,Chandler,What about the obsessive cleaning?
54961,Chandler,"No, you didn't."
54963,Chandler,Because I'm gonna play for ya.
54971,Chandler,"All right Mike, let's get this over with. Sudden death. Whoever wins this point, wins."
54975,Chandler,And that's... how... it's done!
54977,Chandler,"I never sucked, I actually didn't want you to know how good I was!"
54979,Chandler,I don't know.
54997,Chandler,"You know, I'd love to, but I'm a little tired."
55007,Chandler,"He could be alone. This morning I heard him do push-ups, and then talk to his triceps."
55012,Chandler,She's cheating on Joey with Ross!
55032,Chandler,How about the dinosaur twins in the other room? No-one is manning that wall!
55038,Chandler,You do realise that's your brother?
55040,Chandler,That's not true. I came with Monica and I'm leaving with Weird Al.
55053,Chandler,And she's... turning on the TV... and watching... Miss Congeniality!
55062,Chandler,You got it!
55104,Chandler,"Okay, well we'll go back in there, but will you do one thing for us? The people that care about you?"
55136,Chandler,"Not quite. Monica's still at the salon, and I'm just finishing packing."
55138,Chandler,"You're not supposed to take that. Besides, it's a New Testament, what are you gonna do with it?"
55154,Chandler,I think.... I think I can see your scalp.
55162,Chandler,What d'ya know... It's a treat for the eyes and the ears.
55164,Chandler,"Yeah, it's almost if Air Barbados doesn't care about your social life."
55169,Chandler,Wish I could switch with someone. I really don't wanna sit with Allen Iverson over there.
55257,Chandler,"You go back to work tomorrow night, right?"
55259,Chandler,"So if you want people to see them, then by definition you're not having them taken out... say, at the break of dawn?"
55261,Chandler,What are you singing?
55263,Chandler,"It's ""Ride of the Valkyries"" from ""Apocalypse Now""... See, here's the thing: The corn rose were really a solution to your frizzy hair problem. And now that we're home, we don't have that problem anymore, so if you think about it... I hate them!"
55265,Chandler,Did I? Let's refresh. I believe what I said was that I could see your scalp.
55267,Chandler,"Again, let's journey back... As I recall what Rachel said, was she had never notice the shape of your skull before. And Joey... Well, Joey didn't realise that there was anything different."
55269,Chandler,Hit yourself in the tooth?
55307,Chandler,"Honey, you've been in there for a long time... Is everything okay?"
55310,Chandler,Really? What happened?
55312,Chandler,You can't move at all?
55314,Chandler,"If I untangle you, will you please get rid of the corn rose?"
55335,Chandler,"Now that I untangled you, how 'bout you doing a little something for me?"
55337,Chandler,I think you know.
55339,Chandler,This is what I want to do.
55381,Chandler,There's a hair in my coffee.
55385,Chandler,"You know, it's funny. Every time you say ""triplets,"" I immediately think of three hot blonde 19-year olds."
55451,Chandler,"So, a lot of malfunctioning wee-wees and hoo-hoos in this room, huh?"
55452,Chandler,"I mean, you have a lovely home."
55461,Chandler,"You want me to wash my hands first, don't you?"
55466,Chandler,"Hey, you must be Owen."
55468,Chandler,"I'm Chandler. Hey, I was in the scouts too."
55470,Chandler,"Yeah, in fact my father was a den-mother."
55472,Chandler,You know how to use a compass?
55474,Chandler,You do? That's fantastic!
55476,Chandler,"I'd love to, but I gotta get back to talking to your parents. They're telling us all about how they adopted you."
55480,Chandler,I got nothing.
55522,Chandler,Where are Bill and Colleen?
55524,Chandler,We have to leave!!
55526,Chandler,"I didn't get to the bathroom. I bumped into Owen on the way, and he didn't know he was adopted. And there's a slight chance I may have told him."
55531,Chandler,But kids are so intuitive. Don't you think on some level he already knows?
55536,Chandler,Which technically now you should give back!
55538,Chandler,"I'm so sorry, but you should have a sign out there or something. Or at least whisper it to people when they come in the door. ""Owen doesn't know he's adopted, and he also thinks that Santa is real."""
55600,Chandler,"Owen didn't know he was adopted, and Monica told him."
55603,Chandler,"Yeah, but how would you like it if someone told the triplets that you gave birth to them?"
55606,Chandler,"So, you and Rachel tonight, huh?"
55608,Chandler,Wow! So tonight may be the night! You're nervous?
55610,Chandler,What must it be like not to be crippled by fear and self-loathing.
55612,Chandler,How can you be so confident?
55614,Chandler,Really? Like you have a routine?
55627,Chandler,Hey! Stop staring at my wife's legs! No no! Stop staring at your sister's legs!
55629,Chandler,She went on one of those spray-on tan places.
55635,Chandler,"Sure, then you should get a mini skirt so you can really show it off."
55646,Chandler,Are you trying to do a British accent?
55648,Chandler,"Just so I know, how many more of those can I expect?"
55657,Chandler,"No, had it done to me though. Feels good !"
55702,Chandler,Hello? Is someone on the line?
55728,Chandler,Hold on! There is something different.
55730,Chandler,Was that place... The Sun?
55732,Chandler,Oh My God! You can do a duet of Ebony and Ivory all by yourself!
55740,Chandler,How was your date with Joey?
55742,Chandler,You didn't like that?
55794,Chandler,"If she asks, I protested a little, but ok!"
55800,Chandler,"Well, aren't you a treat."
55823,Chandler,"That fake British woman is a real bitch, but she sure can dance... Hey!"
55825,Chandler,"Kinda... you know, sneaking around, having to hide from you guys..."
55828,Chandler,"Actually, no. No, it felt right. You know, it felt like uhm... I can't believe we haven't been doing this the whole time."
55848,Chandler,"Dude, it's Chandler. Let me in."
55850,Chandler,"I know, I went to the tanning place and the same thing happened to me. You have to let me in."
55853,Chandler,"No, I just had to get a picture of this."
55854,Chandler,I see you later!
55857,Chandler,"Honey, I got us that room at the Woodford Inn this weekend."
55865,Chandler,Gee if only she were one and had no idea what the hell a birthday was!
55868,Chandler,There's this thing I really want us to do. I read about it in Maxim...
55873,Chandler,"Fine, but if we end up not doing this Maxim thing because of this party..."
55902,Chandler,Hey hey! Where's the birthday girl?
55904,Chandler,"Oh, sure, she was probably up all night, excited about the party she knows is happening."
55919,Chandler,"I know, what are we gonna do?"
55921,Chandler,I'm not going to Vermont with this Monica!
55982,Chandler,To be fair this one does have nuts.
55986,Chandler,Hi Emma! It's the year 2020. Are you still enjoying your nap?
55994,Chandler,Was that Emma? Is she up?
55999,Chandler,I don't know! You'll tell us on Monday!
56002,Chandler,To the bathroom!
56021,Chandler,"You do know, I can just turn them the other way around, right?"
56041,Chandler,I'm begging you stop.
56048,Chandler,Thats a bear.
56052,Chandler,"Ok, on your mark... Get set... GO!!!"
56057,Chandler,I bought you. How did I forget that that's all you do?
56081,Chandler,"I'm sorry, is this a game for Emma or for Monica?"
56083,Chandler,"Emma, you even know it's your birthday today? You're one! One-year-old, that's little."
56084,Chandler,Ooh! That's my girl!
56086,Chandler,Did I teach her that? Did I just... impart wisdom?
56089,Chandler,There's no-one around. Why don't we just take this one?
56091,Chandler,I was kidding.
56094,Chandler,"No, not yet."
56102,Chandler,"Hey, guys! Come on! You gotta see what Emma just did."
56113,Chandler,"Let's do it, come on!"
56134,Chandler,"Joey, we would've asked you, we just thought you wouldn't be interested."
56141,Chandler,So excited about your letter!
56149,Chandler,So you must be going to somewhere fancy to celebrate?
56154,Chandler,That's where people make number two!!
56236,Chandler,On every word?
56240,Chandler,And that became â€˜they are humid prepossessing Homo Sapiens with full sized aortic pumps...?
56275,Chandler,I doubt that! Tell her about us last year.
56292,Chandler,"Oh, I don't think it was desperate, I think it was amazing!"
56302,Chandler,Sounds good to me... but what would a guy think?
56330,Chandler,Hey Joe! How's the second draft of the letter coming?
56334,Chandler,Can we read it? Can you print out another copy?
56345,Chandler,They thought it was very smart of us to have a child write the recommendation letter.
56347,Chandler,"She guessed 8, 9, based on his drawings."
56351,Chandler,That sounds like fun.
56370,Chandler,Like war. Or that thing in Joey's refrigerator. Remember? It was in a milk carton but it looked like meat?
56381,Chandler,Hey! Monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects!
56477,Chandler,"Hey, I'm sorry, I should have given you guys my black book when I got married! Although it wasn't so much a book as a... napkin. With Janice's phone number on it."
56482,Chandler,Is Monica not here?
56484,Chandler,"Oh, then I'll tell you. My agency was bidding for a big account and they got it! It's my first national commercial!"
56488,Chandler,"Oh... I don't know, I really don't think you're right for the part."
56490,Chandler,"First of all. Bravo. Uh, but I really don't think you're right for this. The part calls for a stuffy college professor."
56492,Chandler,Software that facilitates inter-business networking e-solutions?
56531,Chandler,"Joe, I told you, you're just not right for the part."
56541,Chandler,What am I gonna do now?
56543,Chandler,"He's not right for the part. So if I suggest him, my bosses are gonna think I'm an idiot! And that's something they should learn on their own!"
56598,Chandler,Bad news. I watched the tape and passed it along to my bosses and they weren't interested.
56606,Chandler,"I'm not lying to you, I watched it!"
56608,Chandler,I watched it!
56639,Chandler,I can't believe Joey. I hate being called a liar!
56641,Chandler,What did I just say?
56643,Chandler,"Yes, and I have to say, I am not just hurt. I am insulted. When I tell somebody I did something..."
56645,Chandler,Why are you so sure I didn't watch this tape?
56651,Chandler,He really is a chameleon.
56705,Chandler,"Look, I'm sorry I didn't give them your tape. And I promise, next time to submit you whether I think you are right for the part or not."
56707,Chandler,I know. You're right. What's it gonna take for you to forgive me?
56711,Chandler,Lying is wrong!
56713,Chandler,I'm a pretty little girl.
56758,Chandler,"That's funny, we were doing the same thing!"
56761,Chandler,"Yeah it is really pricey. I mean, I freaked when I first heard the numbers."
56763,Chandler,"It was pretty simple actually, I came up with a couple of cost-cutting solutions, wrote out a list and Monica told me to go to hell."
56777,Chandler,Our adoption social worker is coming by today so we are cleaning the apartment.
56779,Chandler,You know you don't want me to help. You can't have it both ways!
56781,Chandler,Kind of. She's coming by to interview us and see where we live.
56791,Chandler,"I'll admit to the cigarettes and the magazine, but that tape is not mine."
56837,Chandler,"Ok, ok, here we go."
56852,Chandler,But you already gave all your money to charity!
56854,Chandler,I donâ€™t think you can do that!
56856,Chandler,"Thatâ€™s sweet, honey, but save something for the adoption Lady."
56893,Chandler,"Oh, because we love kids. Love â€˜em to death.Well, not actually to death, that's just a figure of speech - we love kids the appropriate amount... as allowed by law."
56898,Chandler,"But other than that... wholesome, wholesome building."
56906,Chandler,Of course it was!
56914,Chandler,"Oh, it's just some crazy guy who roams the halls here. He's great with kids though."
56936,Chandler,"WE'LL TALK TO YOU LATER, BERT. EVERYTHNG'S FINE!!"
56939,Chandler,Oh yeah! He has a caretaker. His older brother... Ernie.
56954,Chandler,What the hell are you doing?
56956,Chandler,"Well, we're not."
56958,Chandler,We don't have a code word.
56975,Chandler,I can explain... Joey...
56988,Chandler,"Oh, that's really ok."
57015,Chandler,Hello...? Have you seen Joey's bat?
57034,Chandler,Yeah. We don't feel like we can host Thanksgiving this year.
57038,Chandler,"Well, it's just with uhm, work and the stress of adoption, we just don't feel like we have the energy. Plus, we don't think it's fair that every year the burden falls on us."
57040,Chandler,"No, no! We made this decision together."
57052,Chandler,Don't let yourself get manipulated this way!
57054,Chandler,We are supposed to make these decisions together! Did you not watch the Doctor Phil I taped for you?
57083,Chandler,Why come all the way from Kansas to do that?
57085,Chandler,"You know what just occurred to me? This could be our last Thanksgiving just the two of us. I mean, we could be getting a baby soon!"
57087,Chandler,Somebody is gonna pick us.
57093,Chandler,"You know, you always cook this meal all by yourself. Let me help this year."
57095,Chandler,"I'm serious, let me do something, just not the turkey or the stuffing, nothing ""high profile""."
57097,Chandler,Tell me more.
57099,Chandler,You obviously haven't tasted my Palmolive potatoes!
57104,Chandler,Oh my God!
57109,Chandler,"Hmm, the game's at one."
57111,Chandler,"Dinner is at four, we'll never gonna make it back."
57113,Chandler,"You say that now, but it could take us a long time to get back home. Plus Joey could get lost and and they could have to page us to go pick him up."
57115,Chandler,"Look, Monica has been working hard all day, she didn't wanna host this thing in the first place, we shouldn't go!"
57159,Chandler,I can't believe they are not here! I slave and I slave for what? They've ruined cranberry day!
57249,Chandler,HA-HA! All you got was Monica's stinky Brussels sprouts!
57251,Chandler,Please let me stay on this side of the door.
57269,Chandler,The floating heads do make a good point.
57282,Chandler,"Well, you manheads aren't any better. You lied about going to the game. You knew it would make you late, and you still went anyway."
57288,Chandler,That would be a lot more convincing if you weren't drooling.
57305,Chandler,A little late for that.
57308,Chandler,"Uhm, we've got turkey grease."
57318,Chandler,Can you ever feel your ears?
57332,Chandler,"Okay, look, I'm gonna pull on the door and you guys push as hard as you can. Maybe we can get enough room to wiggle him out, okay? Okay, so PUSH!"
57335,Chandler,"Come on guys, PUSH!"
57340,Chandler,Argh! I can't believe what you did. Monica's gonna kill you!
57343,Chandler,What's going on?
57358,Chandler,That is the exact same thing.
57362,Chandler,"We're just here to say goodbye, we're off to Ohio."
57366,Chandler,And so incorrect!
57369,Chandler,"Uhm, thank you, but we're really trying not to get our hopes up."
57371,Chandler,"Yeah. I mean, this girl could decide against adoption or she could like another couple better.."
57373,Chandler,I can develop a condition in which I talk and talk and no one hears a word.
57376,Chandler,So we're standing firm on the 'not getting our hopes up'?
57380,Chandler,"Oh, screw it, I'm gonna be a daddy!!"
57417,Chandler,"Yeah. Just weird, you know. It's like: ""Hi, I'm Chandler. May I have the human growing inside you?"""
57419,Chandler,You're gonna be great.
57424,Chandler,Thank you so much for agreeing to see us.
57429,Chandler,That's what our friends call us.
57483,Chandler,"So, the fact that I am a doctor, and my wifeâ€™s a reverend, thatâ€™s important to you?"
57486,Chandler,Plus I thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor!
57495,Chandler,No-ot for me it doesnâ€™t.
57499,Chandler,"Yeah, actually. So, you read a file that you liked and you gave the agency the serial number and they contacted us?"
57501,Chandler,You should be. Youâ€™re really on top of stuff..
57507,Chandler,"Yeah, I did."
57524,Chandler,We are NOT signing those papers.
57526,Chandler,It's wrong. They made a mistake. They think we're somebody else.
57528,Chandler,You have gotta stop!
57530,Chandler,She likes Doctor Chandler and Reverend Monica.
57532,Chandler,"Your Veal Chop is $34,95!"
57534,Chandler,But we are not the one she chose! How can you feel okay about this?
57541,Chandler,"So, we'll tell the truth and who knows, maybe she'll like us for us."
57600,Chandler,The agency must have made some mistake. My wife is not a reverend and I'm not a doctor.
57603,Chandler,I could perform an operation on you and prove it if you'd like.
57606,Chandler,"Well, our names really are Monica and Chandler. We're from New York."
57617,Chandler,You have every reason to be upset. We did lie. But only because we've been waiting and trying to have a baby for so long. Now we don't know how long it's gonna be before we can get another chance again.
57619,Chandler,"Erica, please. Just consider us. Ask them to see our file. Our last name's Bing. My wife's a chef and I'm in advertising."
57621,Chandler,"But you did like us. And you should. My wife's an incredible woman. She's loving and devoted and caring. And don't tell her I said this but the woman's always right... I love my wife more than anything in this world. And I... It kills me that I can't give her a baby... I really want a kid. And when that day finally comes, I'll learn how to be a good dad. But my wife... she's already there. She's a mother... without a baby... Please?"
57622,Chandler,You still want that baby?
57663,Chandler,"Oh, uhm... I have to work too. Yeah, I'm stuck at the office all day."
57665,Chandler,Those are all really old!
57677,Chandler,I was in the car with Nancy all day.
57679,Chandler,"Well, at least the perfume is not mine, be thankful for that!"
57681,Chandler,Itâ€™s perfect. Itâ€™s everything weâ€™ve been looking for.
57685,Chandler,And the fireplace in the bedroom.
57687,Chandler,This is bringing out a lovely color in you!
57689,Chandler,I donâ€™t know. What do you think?
57691,Chandler,I do too.
57695,Chandler,"I donâ€™t know what you mean, giant talking cigarette! Oh, by the way, Phoebe called just as I was getting into Nancyâ€™s car, so if she asks you, I was at work all day."
57697,Chandler,"We donâ€™t. Not until it's a hundred percent. I mean, why upset everybody over nothing."
57699,Chandler,I know. Gooooood luck with it.
57729,Chandler,"Is it me, or have the greetings gone downhill around here?"
57746,Chandler,...and a street where our kids can ride their bikes and maybe an ice-cream truck can go by.
57752,Chandler,"Actually, we already found a house we love."
57755,Chandler,"Bet you wish I was having an affair now, huh?"
57760,Chandler,I know this is really hard and we're really sorry.
57776,Chandler,"Hey, that's...'joincidence' with a 'C'!"
57794,Chandler,"If you win, we give up the birds."
57796,Chandler,"But if we win, we get your apartment."
57836,Chandler,Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving day for us!
57842,Chandler,"Well, I think, I think Ross knows about me and Monica."
57845,Chandler,"Look, we're not just messing around! I love her. Okay, I'm in love with her."
57871,Chandler,"Little toast here. I know this isn't exactly the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked."
57881,Chandler,"Hello? It's Nancy, they responded to our offer."
57894,Chandler,"That's okay, we understand."
57897,Chandler,"Yeah... Well, it's a good thing we got it then."
57899,Chandler,We got the house.
57901,Chandler,I just didn't want to tell you in front of them.
57905,Chandler,We're growing up.
57907,Chandler,So who's gonna tell them?
57909,Chandler,Not it! Damn it!
57920,Chandler,"Well, I didn't know how to tell you before, but... We got the house."
57935,Chandler,What did I marry into?
57943,Chandler,You guys just keep getting cooler and cooler!
57956,Chandler,"You're right, by saying ""nice"" I'm virtually licking her."
57958,Chandler,Are you asking permission to break the pact?
57961,Chandler,"Awesome, the name really stands out."
57963,Chandler,"Man, we're gonna rock that Asian student union!"
57967,Chandler,"You know, our band is playing on Friday."
57976,Chandler,"I know it. You know, I'm totally gonna ask her out."
57978,Chandler,"I said it first, bro."
57982,Chandler,Totally. I had sex in High school...
57984,Chandler,"All right, I'd say we make a pact. Neither of us will go out with Missy Goldberg."
57986,Chandler,"All right, so that's Missy Goldberg, Phoebe Cates and Molly Ringwald, who neither of us can go out with."
57988,Chandler,"Oh, and Sheena Easton. But we probably couldn't get her anyway."
57990,Chandler,"Well, I officially give you permission to break the pact."
57992,Chandler,Your hands are shaking.
58116,Chandler,"Ross, that was 16 years ago!"
58128,Chandler,"Oh please, and you knew how much I liked her."
58165,Chandler,Soo... you girls having fun?
58170,Chandler,Well maybe if you go to school here next year we can totally hang out.
58172,Chandler,"Well, maybe you can get in on a beauty scholarship."
58174,Chandler,So where are you applying to?
58176,Chandler,I'm in college and I'm in a band.
58228,Chandler,"Yeah, but it was like a million years ago, so it doesn't matter."
58232,Chandler,You kissed her that night too?
58234,Chandler,"Seriously, where did this happen?"
58236,Chandler,Oh wait... What bed did you say she was on?
58238,Chandler,I'm pretty sure I put her on my bed.
58240,Chandler,"Why would I kiss a girl, and then put her on your bed?"
58251,Chandler,What did I marry into?
58291,Chandler,"You look great. I'm so glad we're having this rehearsal dinner, you know, I so rarely get to practice my meals before I eat them."
58293,Chandler,No stupid jokes. I thought that was for the actual wedding.
58335,Chandler,"I know, I hate being left out of things."
58338,Chandler,Fine. We're just sitting here. Alone. Doing nothing. It's our rehearsal for tomorrow.
58346,Chandler,"Pick me, I look great in a tux and I will not steal focus."
58350,Chandler,"Oh, I will. But I will need a mirror... as he is me!"
58352,Chandler,You are going downer!
58366,Chandler,Mike didn't tell you? You have to chose one of us to be in your wedding. One of his groomsmen fell out.
58368,Chandler,Just not enough to put us in the original wedding party.
58430,Chandler,"Hey, can I talk to you about this groomsman thing? If you pick Ross, he'll walk you down the isle just fine. But if you choose me, you'll be getting some comedy!"
58446,Chandler,How's it going?
58454,Chandler,I'm not supposed to tell you.
58459,Chandler,"Rach, Rach, knock knock."
58461,Chandler,I'll tell you at the wedding.
58503,Chandler,"So technically, would this person be in the wedding?"
58542,Chandler,Wow! Aren't you gonna be cold?
58544,Chandler,You look beautiful.
58563,Chandler,That really was an incredible wedding.
58565,Chandler,"I'd love to, but it's 2300 hours and I'm about to have the most organized sex anyone's ever had."
58567,Chandler,I don't know. Maybe he hooked up with that hot girl he was talking to.
58575,Chandler,"So, where's Mike?"
58591,Chandler,Why are you wearing my apron?
58606,Chandler,"Oh, those places! There's always so many people, their being corralled like cattle, and... you know, there's always some idiot who goes ""Mooooo""!"
58614,Chandler,I'm so sorry...
58649,Chandler,"Monica. Calm, self."
58652,Chandler,Why would you say that?
58749,Chandler,"Yeah, I've been to these places before, but I've never really seen them, you know."
58754,Chandler,"Oh, uhm, okay, uhm, do you mind if we ask you some questions about the father?"
58760,Chandler,"So, what does the other guy do? Does he go to college too?"
58764,Chandler,I'll bet his dad doesn't think so.
58768,Chandler,"Honey, it's us. Of course it's the shovel-killer."
58770,Chandler,I'd keep an eye on him! We have to find out which one the father is.
58772,Chandler,"I dunno, aren't there tests for these things, right?"
58774,Chandler,"Pff, easy for you to say, he's a father killer. He probably loves him mommy. He's probably got a tattoo that says ""mom"" on his shovel-wielding arm!"
58812,Chandler,Hey! How was lunch?
58818,Chandler,"Oh God. It's shovely-Joe, isn't it?"
58820,Chandler,How do you know?
58822,Chandler,Oh God! What was it? The thing that we hardly ever do or the thing we never do?
58889,Chandler,"Yeah, I don't know why we hang out with married couples more often."
58895,Chandler,A dinosaur died a million years ago?
58916,Chandler,YOU NEVER DID IT!
58918,Chandler,"Hey! I will have you know that... aah, who am I kidding. Let's call the kid Geller and let Bing die with me."
58926,Chandler,Hey Joe! We've got a couple of things we've got to check out at the new house. You want to come with us?
58929,Chandler,"Yeah, come with us. You'll see how close it is to the city."
58991,Chandler,That's what we were gonna name the baby.
58998,Chandler,"Hey, how'd the interview go?"
59000,Chandler,"You know, I always feel that way after an interview. I'll bet it went better than you think."
59002,Chandler,That is a bad interview.
59013,Chandler,Ooh! Israeli champagne. And it's vanilla!
59036,Chandler,"And thank you for explaining to us what escrow means... I've already forgotten what you said, but thank you."
59048,Chandler,"When your head was hanging out the window, it didn't hit a mailbox, did it?"
59139,Chandler,"Man, those two dogs are going at it!"
59144,Chandler,Really? What changed your mind?
59146,Chandler,"Joey, there was a little girl who lived here, but she died like 30 years ago."
59148,Chandler,Ha! I'm just messing with you.
59152,Chandler,You don't think we'd buy a house and not have a Joey room do you?
59188,Chandler,"For your information, I was staring at her baby. We're about to be parents."
59196,Chandler,How did the job stuff go?
59208,Chandler,How did the job stuff go?
59214,Chandler,Or facing a bitch of a commute.
59238,Chandler,"Well, it makes me feel sad, but..."
59245,Chandler,Is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes?
59250,Chandler,"We close escrow tomorrow, so seeing another house can only confuse us, and we're easily confused. We're not very bright."
59252,Chandler,What do you think Pheebs?
59262,Chandler,I know. *He* always wanted to be the first black man to cross the Atlantic.
59267,Chandler,"Unless Snoopy says it to Charlie Brown, I think we're okay."
59329,Chandler,"It feels like weâ€™re cheating on our house. And if weâ€™re gonna cheat, shouldnâ€™t it be with like a hot, younger house, that does stuff that our house wonâ€™t do?"
59348,Chandler,And yet I never run into Beyonce!
59356,Chandler,This can not be happening!
59358,Chandler,"The only way that that is going to happen, is if the other couple are the Hitlers."
59360,Chandler,"That is a great idea! And by the way, I don't mean to sound distasteful, but when did you start crapping money!?"
59362,Chandler,"Alright alright, we still have three hours till escrow closes on our house. We can still get out."
59392,Chandler,The Hitlers will be so disappointed.
59394,Chandler,Wait! I just want you to know that... I'm so happy you're going to be here.
59396,Chandler,Because... that way... we can pick up where we left off.
59398,Chandler,I never stopped loving you.
59400,Chandler,"Yeah, yeah, yeah! I want you... I need you... I must have you Janice Litman Goralnik Neihosenstein."
59402,Chandler,"Now that you live next door, we can be together every day. Sid and Monica never have to know a thing."
59406,Chandler,Don't say that. Don't tangle the dream and take it away.
59450,Chandler,So we thought we'd throw you little going away party around seven.
59459,Chandler,Where's your passport?
59461,Chandler,"Well, it's not."
59499,Chandler,We're taking a break!
59501,Chandler,Jumping on the bed?
59504,Chandler,"No, no, no, guys. She's right. We should get to work. I'll take stuff out of the closet, Joey you pack 'em and Ross you re-pack whatever Joey packs."
59509,Chandler,I didn't know Monica had these!
59511,Chandler,Why would she use them with Richard and not me? I can be kinky! I once did a naked dance for her... with scarves!
59557,Chandler,"Oh, yes. I decided to leave these out for you in case Richard stops by and you wanna engage on a little light bondage and moustache play!"
59559,Chandler,"Oh yeah, right! Good luck getting another scarf dance from me!"
59561,Chandler,Really? Then what are they doing in our guestroom?
59596,Chandler,"No, no, no... They're really yours. We... found them in your old room."
59598,Chandler,"Don't say Richard! Well, if they're not Monica's and they're not yours, then whose are they?"
59602,Chandler,I think these are yours.
59608,Chandler,"Let me just say something... Because once we get into this, I'm gonna get all uncomfortable and probably make some stupid joke... I just want to say that I... I love you... And, I'm gonna miss you. And I'm so sad that you're leaving."
59613,Chandler,"I'm sor... Just go. Just go. I can't, I can't."
59616,Chandler,"Oh, you're definately not. I haven't cried like that in years."
59618,Chandler,That old woman was being scammed by her mechanic.
59637,Chandler,Mine was a humdinger
59650,Chandler,"Well, you can't say we don't know how to throw a party."
59655,Chandler,Joey and I can finish up in the guest room.
59662,Chandler,"Hey Mon, I think I figured out whose handcuffs they are."
59664,Chandler,"Well, I was cleaning out the closet and I found some pictures of them... being used."
59677,Chandler,Relax! We just get her some antacids.
59679,Chandler,Oh my God!
59682,Chandler,"Honey, it's gonna be okay."
59711,Chandler,Relax! We'll just get her some antacids.
59713,Chandler,Oh my God!
59726,Chandler,"Next time, can I say breathe?"
59730,Chandler,Where are you going?
59732,Chandler,You can't leave me alone with her.
59734,Chandler,This is exactly the kind of social situation that I am not comfortable with!
59736,Chandler,"It's just that we've never spent any time, you know, alone together."
59739,Chandler,"So, ah... Any plans for the summer?"
59741,Chandler,"Hah. May not wanna mention this. So, you ever wonder which is worse, you know; going through labor or getting kicked in the nuts?"
59743,Chandler,"Well, it's just interesting. You know, because no one will ever know, because no one can experience both."
59744,Chandler,"One of life's great, unanswerable questions. I mean, who knows? Maybe there's something even more painful than those things? Like this."
59802,Chandler,Is it really that bad?
59808,Chandler,"Alright. Wow, that is one disgusting miracle."
59817,Chandler,"Well, that's spongy."
59819,Chandler,I know. He has your eyes.
59820,Chandler,"I mean, I know that's not possible, but he does."
59825,Chandler,How do you feel?
59832,Chandler,"Oh, yeah! These are the faces of two people in the know!"
59834,Chandler,"Well, gosh. That makes me feel so special and good."
59842,Chandler,What do we do?
59846,Chandler,"Uh-huh! Join me, won't you?! Okay, what do you say we keep one, and then just like have an option on the other one?"
59848,Chandler,"Why not? We could give each of them half a medallion, and then years later, they'll find each other and be reunited. I mean, that's a great day for everybody."
59850,Chandler,What if they're not? What if it's adopted by a king?
59852,Chandler,"Monica, we are not ready to have two babies!"
59900,Chandler,"Maybe. Unless they're like two people who have lived in apartments next to each other for years, and then one day they're pushed through a vagina and they meet."
59911,Chandler,Have fun at church-camp!
59913,Chandler,I know! You ready to trade?
59917,Chandler,We could trade later.
59959,Chandler,Her name is Erica.
59962,Chandler,Yeah. It's a shame you two didn't get to spend more time together.
59977,Chandler,I love you.
60001,Chandler,"I have no idea what's going on, but I am excited!"
60043,Chandler,"We were wondering what was taking so long with the gift, but now we understand you were doing this."
60045,Chandler,Really? You got us a chick and a duck?
60048,Chandler,"Oh, don't worry, we'll find them."
60053,Chandler,"It's okay, it's just an egg roll."
60058,Chandler,"Okay, let's find these birds."
60062,Chandler,"Well, that can't be good!"
60066,Chandler,"Oh, tons, I'm quite the woodsman."
60068,Chandler,"Joey, wait! The ball!"
60071,Chandler,I don't know. Maybe we can open this up somehow.
60073,Chandler,No... It's all glued together.
60075,Chandler,I don't know. Maybe.
60077,Chandler,I know! It's.. It's the foosball table.
60079,Chandler,Did that movie ever get made?
60129,Chandler,"And we're also gonna buy you tiny, bird hearing-aids."
60131,Chandler,What's the matter?
60137,Chandler,"Well, I can't do it either."
60140,Chandler,"We have to bust it open, but neither of us can do it!"
60183,Chandler,That was... Impressive.
60186,Chandler,"Sorry about the table, man."
60188,Chandler,You gonna buy a new one?
60190,Chandler,"Well, at least we got these little guys out."
60192,Chandler,"Aww, we were worried about you! Hm. I guess I better get used to things crapping in my hand, huh?"
60194,Chandler,"Hey, you know what? Maybe we should keep them here with you."
60196,Chandler,"Yeah, I mean we've got a lot going on right now. And, plus, here they'd have their own room."
60198,Chandler,"You know, I - I think you're set with the poultry."
60200,Chandler,"I think there may be another reason. So, awkward hug or lame cool guy handshake?"
60238,Chandler,"Wow, this is weird."
60286,Chandler,"Oh, it's gonna be okay."
